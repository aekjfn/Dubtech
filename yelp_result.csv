At least once a week. I order the same thing each time : tofu sweet and sour no rice 4 spicy--
It's hit or miss. They sometimes give me chicken, there are times it only has 2 tomatoes a few carrots and a piece of celery as the vegetable, and the whole month of December every time I ordered lunch they'd give me / charge me for dinner sizes-- and I just had to accept it.
Can't stress enough that I continue to order from here because when it's good, it's so good!
I gave it a 3/5 bc 3/5 times I get my order exactly how I placed it."

Was served meat after explicitly saying I do not eat meat.
I came in at lunch when it was dead with about four other patrons in the restaurant. I ordered yellow curry with brown rice no chicken add shrimp. He asked me, ""ok chicken and shrimp curry?"" I clearly clarified, ""No. Absolutely no chicken. I do not eat chicken or meat. Yellow curry, brown rice, shrimp only."" My order came out with white rice and to my dismay, chicken which I discovered after I began eating.
Multiple people came in, got seated, waited then got up and left because no one would serve them. The workers could care less. I could understand if they were busy but it almost seemed as if they were hiding in the back because they did not know what they were doing. Me and another woman couldn't get anyone to help us pay our bill. We asked multiple times, went to the back, front and kitchen and were both late to work because they would not help us and had no access to change. There are so many amazing food places in Capitol Hill that will not only get your order correct but put in an effort to give great customer service. Such a bummer."

I ordered a ""2-star"" pineapple fried rice for pick up and the restaurant made the order incorrectly; the ticket on the to-go bag actually read, ""4-star"". I generally never go out of my way to send food back at restaurants but the food was inedible due to how spicy it was. So, I called and informed them of the mistake, to which she clearly said that if I returned the uneaten meal, she would remake my order and refund my money. Sadly, she did neither of these but lied to me and disrespected me instead.
I returned to the restaurant and also returned the uneaten food as instructed. She took the food to the back and after a few minutes the female employee came out and gave me the ""new order"" of fried rice. I inspected the container and to my discovery, realized she just buried the old order with more steamed rice. I believe she tried to mix it up in attempts to dilute the spice but I could blatantly see that the rice on top was white and the rice below it was still smothered in chili flakes. I took a taste test to verify and it was still incredibly spicy. Keep in mind she was standing next to me the whole time. I called her out and told her that the order was not fresh and still spicy. She said I was wrong and that if I wanted a new order I had to pay. (Please understand that the initial situation was the restaurant getting my order wrong.)
In attempts to just get out of there, I asked if she could refund my order like she stated on the phone. Of course, she said that I could not be refunded and keep the food. quote: ""No, if you want a refund you have to give me the rice. You can't have both. If you want I'll give you a refund and you can go around the corner and eat at McDonald's.""
....dead
Simple economics consists of a trade of goods and services for money. I had an agreement with Jai Thai to exchange money for food but the food I was given was not what I had asked for. Because of this we both made a verbal agreement to alleviate the matter by me exchanging the incorrect order for a correct one and to also be refunded my money. I didn't receive a refund nor did I receive the correct order, instead I was lied to and disrespected. Why would you lie and make me go back if you were not going to return my food? Terrible business."

We got the Panang curry, pineapple curry, and ""phad see lew..."" well the curries tasted exactly the same except you added a can of pineapple pieces to one of them.

There are way better places for as good a deal or better.
I ordered the drunken noodles, crab delight appetizer, and black rice pudding dessert. Crab appetizer was crunchy but the filling had no flavor and a nauseating texture. Noodles were ok, but the meat in them (I got beef and chicken) was dry, tough, and flavorless like old leather. Maybe getting the noodles with only vegetables would be ok, but still not great as the noodles and sauce were very mediocre. The pudding was excessively, sickeningly sweet.
Overall a waste of money, I ate barely a quarter of each item and threw the rest away. 2 stars only because the noodles (without the meat) were not terrible, and if I had ordered them that way, I might have somewhat enjoyed them."

I went to Jai Thai once, and it was a one and done for me.
The food was AMAZING, but the service was HORRENDOUS. The only reason I am giving the place two stars is because of the food. The moment we sat down in the restaurant, we were literally ignored and they did not even acknowledge us. I had to asked to be served. Also, the serving staff did not come and check on us at all. In order to get a refill on my drink, I had to literally get up away from my table and ask the server to please refill my soda. The service was COMICALLY horrible. They placed an order that no one in the entire restaurant or to-go had ordered. The server said ""I must have placed that order on accident."" She was running around like a chicken with her head cut off, and all I could do was laugh at the ridiculousness and incompetence that was happening right before my eyes. A process from sit down to exit that in a decent restaurant, takes an hour, took us over two just to eat and get out at Jai Thai, and there was hardly anyone there!
I had the fried rice with beef and it was delicious. HOWEVER, the spring rolls were another story. They were so greasy, it tasted like I was eating a can of Crisco, literally. It was awful.
Overall, customer service is HORRIBLE, and again I say HORRIBLE. However, the food is actually good Thai food, in my opinion.

I just paid $17 out the door for a plate of noodles and rice with a little curry on the side. The total paid included a $2 premium for prawns of which there were 3 medium small ones.
Here's a news flash from someone who's been in the U District for 8 years. When your clients are mostly students, you must offer real value consistently and not ever be stingy. Restaurants that don't ""get"" this don't last on our Ave. These clowns won't either."

Came in and the staff was disgusting in thai, how a table had just walked out without paying.
We were seated at a table that was not clean. Then the waitress walked away and did not return with our menus or waters. When she returned she asked what we wanted to order. Then she finally realized that she had forgotten our menus. Then we asked if our table could be wiped down again because it was so sticky.
I ordered a dish for my daughter that came with sticky rice. She came back after put in our order to see if it was ok to sub the sticky rice with jasmin rice. I told her that was fine. She was not 4eally aware of what is available. The kitchen probably did not want to make the sticky rice since it takes so long.
I watched as she sat another large party where their table was not clean either. Then usually menus are either presented to the diners in hand or ibfront of them. She just handed a stack of menus to one person to hand out to everyone.
Finally one of our food items came after about 15 minutes (not bad) wich was the pork skewers. The skewers were warm rather than hot.
I was just not impressed with service and food was was too salty."

In the end, they said that all the mangos they had were either too ripe when they cut them open or not ripe enough to try to prepare. To compensate, a cook left the restaurant, went to a market up the street, and purchased fresh ripe mangoes for our dish. It was incredibly nice of them and exhibited such a high level of service and care for their customers. On top of the welcoming staff and amazing service, the sticky rice itself was delicious!

There's a young woman that is usually holding down the fort at lunch time and she's the BEST! She is so sweet and friendly. She's attentive and makes sure your food and bill comes out quick, which is especially appreciated at lunch. She also gave me a free side of rice when I got the rest of my food to go. The cook staff is also very friendly (I could talk to them since the bar seating is right next to the kitchen). When she got busy, they filled in the gap to see how they could help.

Not that I paid particular attention, but from memory it seemed like Pink Door has been all over my Yelp feed since forever--I think every foodie that lives in Seattle, or has been to Seattle, has Yelped this place. So, I had to...
But for those that aren't from Seattle, or I guess I should say for those from California cause I heard other states have similar, but it appears many restaurants, even the really popular ones are REALLY REALLY REALLY hard to find. Like I tried to get to this popular bar the next day and it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor with NO SIGNS outside the building. Really no way to know how to get there without being told...
and yeah, so Pink Door is one of those. First, it's in an alley. Luckily the GPS does hint at that. BUT, I spent the longest time trying to find the entrance cause there's NO SIGN outside, and THERE IS NO PINK DOOR (unless I'm color blind?) The door IS NOT PINK. So, if you see this plain door but hear some trance or other form of electronica, this is probably the place, so you can open the door.
Yeah, so trance... when I walked in, there was a girl hanging from the ceiling on a rope, dancing in the air like a ballerina, accompanied by some trance. So, it's a mostly-traditional Italian restaurant food-wise, with an extremely modern vibe. Interesting.
Food though is above average but not particularly great...
1. Pink Door Mocktail (Non-Alcoholic) $8 ""bartenders seasonal creation"": Don't. Unless you wanna pay $8 for a lemonade. Mocktail my ass. 1/10
2. Cup of Riobolita $10 ""the traditional Tuscan vegetable & bread soup w/ cannellini beans and parmigiano reggiano, a wooden spoon should be able to stand up in the pot"": I did try to stand a spoon in it... and waddya know, it fell but got pretty close. I think if it were a normal sized spoon it might have done it! Think of this soup as a vegetable stew, with just a little but of French onion topping. As for the ""bread soup"" part, I'm not sure where the bread went--maybe as a thickener? Anyway, it was okay, but not particularly special. 6/10
3. Cioppino Pink Door $27 ""prawns, rock fish, mussels, clams and clamari in a spicy tomato and white wine broth"": Compared to others I've had, the soup here is pretty thin and super peppery, though I did enjoy the abundant seafood flavor. It's also served piping hot, which was nice compared to other restaurants. The mussels were tiny, but cooked absolutely perfectly with super plump flesh. The fish was just okay--not dry but definitely not moist. Shrimp was good and still crunchy, but not really what I'd expect of ""prawns""--they're just the same shelled, curled shrimp you see in standard Chinese food. Strangely, there was absolutely no carbs served??? No toast, no nothing. Weird huh? 6/10
4. Flourless Chocolate Cake $11 ""port wine, poached seckel pear, pomegranate port sauce"": Well, this is NOT a cake--but the waiter did warn me, so I guess I can't fault them too much for the false advertising. It's basically a chocolate bar of gaunache (fancy word for semi-soft chocolate) with a braised pear on top. I did like the tart sauce that was packed with berries, but otherwise there wasn't much to this dessert. But I suppose, if you're a true chocolate lover it might float your boat. 6/10
I am really tempted to give them brownie points for just being really cool, but honestly I wouldn't go back cause the food wasn't worth a second visit and I'm sure there are less fancy but better tasting Italian restaurants in Seattle, so...
(but I do think you should come here once sooner or later just to experience how weird and modern a ""traditional"" Italian restaurant can be while still being ""cool"" and without being annoying.)
Oooooooooooooooooh f it.... I guess it's worth a special visit just cuz... (but seriously, the food is just a 3)
4/5

Sat at the bar and the waiters and waitresses alike were all friendly. There was one waiter - I forgot his name but he was super nice!
Service: Terrific and professional - almost fine dining-like.
Food: Ordered the appetizer - squash with bacon and nuts on it; thought I'd needed this one because I assumed the pasta wouldn't be enough. It was yummy but I actually didn't like squash as much. Ordered the beef ragu pasta and OMG it was toooooo good! I would order this again and again. I heard the butter and sage was also delicious!
Pricing: Be prepared to spend a bit more than your usual fare for dinner or lunch. This place is pricey - their service and quality of food makes up for it as they should if they are going to charge that much.
View from the Bar: If you are on a date or just traveling solo - I recommend sitting by the bar. I really enjoyed watching the workers make the pasta live! It was so fun to watch! You get to see them cut the noodles and slice and dice it. They seemed like perfectionist and made sure all of them were equal in size!"

I was so excited to come here with my hubby for date night last night and must say kudos all around.
Food: we usually splurge when it comes to date night and spared no expense at Spinasse. We ordered two small pastas, two entrees, a side of veggies and two desserts. We ordered the butter sage tajarin and the the agnolotti. The portions were definitely small which was perfect for shareable dishes. The tajarin was rich and buttery and kind of had this melt in your mouth aspect to it. It was good but i would likely get the version with meat my next time around. I'm a gal who likes meat. Then came out entrees. Hubby got the beef cheek dish and I got the trout. I was dumbfounded when what looked like an entire fish arrived in front of me - skin , tail and all! I was expecting a filet and that was def not what I got. It honestly didn't look appetizing at all but was well seasoned and damn delicious when I got into it. Hubby loved his dish as well. I liked how the flavors of both of our dishes were complex but yet light at the same time of that makes any sense. It was a sophisticated delight to eat. We had sautéed kale with our meal and while it was good, it was honestly a little too salty. Then came dessert. Hubby got the apple tart and I got tiramisu. Both were BOMB. The tiramisu was rich and creamy, so good. Highly recommend both! We left extremely satisfied!
Service: the food at Spinasse is 4.75 stars but the service tips it to 5 easily. As mentioned, we had a reservation for 6:45pm on Friday night. We arrived at the restaurant at exactly 6:45p and was seated IMMEDIATELY. So many restaurants fall short of this gold standard unfortunately. In addition to be being seated promptly, we were also tended to frequently and the wait staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
Atmosphere: small cozy classy restaurant but sans the 'tude. I can dig it. The restaurant is lively without being loud. Most patrons were on intimate dates and this is perfect spot for it.
Overall: excellent date night spot. Excellent food. Will return absolutely."

I get nervous when I have to give a credit card in advance for a reservation, but I was dedicated and ready to commit. This place had been on my list for a while. OpenTable only had reservations very late in the evening, and when we called via phone (the horror!), they were able to accommodate seating us earlier, which was amazing because I was exhausted.
It has a dark ambiance. I don't know what rustic actually means, but maybe it was that? The table was ready and set up when we got there, so that was appreciated. The server was very cool. And that didn't prevent him from being very polite and providing excellent service throughout the meal.
The bruschetta was not what I typically think of when I think of bruschetta but it was amazing. The tajarin is one of their staple things, and I enjoyed that. The cavatelli with braised beef short rib ragu was definitely to the next level goodness. At this point in ordering food, I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to eat more, but somehow that wasn't an issue when the food came out and ordering the pancetta was not a mistake.
We ended the meal with this chocolate torta thing that was so balanced - it wasn't too heavy or overly chocolately. And the grappa pairing that they recommended was so on point.
I will definitely be coming back. I appreciate the great service, the recommended pairings worked really well, and all of the dishes that were ordered were consistently excellent."

"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Owlburt L.","Went here last Saturday with the wife and our daughter for a belated birthday dinner. I had been excited and had high expectations based on the reviews. I booked this over a month ago and was hoping for a great experience.
Unfortunately we were both quite disappointed. The service was good but that is expected for a high end restaurant like this.
The food, however, was a major disappointment.
We started with the Uva Con Gorgonzola and the Cippollini Ripiene (both highly recommended by our waiter). The Uva Con Gorgonzola was an interesting dish most of which is I have never paid $15 for about 10 green and red grapes cut in half with 5 crumbled pieces of cheese and some hazelnuts. The balance just wasn't there for us. The grapes were sweet, the dressing has some zing to it and the cheese was just too salty. The Cippollini Ripiene wasn't too bad but it was again, overly salted.Unfortunately the ""overly salty"" theme was to be repeat itself to every dish we ordered afterwards.
And I am someone who usually puts extra salt on everything. Hell I even have slightly high blood pressure because of the amount of sodium I ingest.
We then ordered half orders the Tajarin al Ragu and Agnolotti dal plin and the Pancetta Ripiena. Although all the dishes were not badly made, the fact that all them were overly salty, ended up overpowering any ""complex"" flavoring that might have existed under it.
With drinks our bill came out to abut $180 plus gratuity. In the end was basically $100 per person (since our daughter didn't really eat anything), which is way overpriced for something that was nothing special and overly salty.
We won't be back and that's unfortunate since we really wanted to like this place. I am not a penny pincher when it come to eating out, I don't mind shelling out the money for good food, but why pay 4 times more for something you can get at places Il Nilo or Il Corvo that is much better."

Spinasse was maybe the third one that came up, but they had me at fresh made pasta. And oh my, the pasta...
But im skipping ahead. The restaurant itself is nondescript from the outside, sandwiched between a couple of other Capitol hill eateries. Inside is clean and close, with a rustic feel. Depending on where you sit, you can watch pasta being made in the kitchen... long sheets of beautiful, yellow, eggy pasta... I'm getting hungry again..
Service was prompt, friendly, and generally fantastic, with care given to cleaning the table between courses and being careful to not touch the silverware and plates as they were being replaced. We even got an extra candle and a couple of Happy Anniversaries! towards the end of our meal.
The food was even better. To start, we had a poached egg in cheese fondue and a savory shallot flan served over spinach and topped with fried shallots. Both were excellent, but I could eat that flan every day for a year.
Main courses were pasta in brown butter sage sauce, and prosciutto-stuffed pork belly. The pasta was, in a word, perfect. The stuffed pork belly was pork stuffed in more pork, with an herbed demi-glaze, and roasted potatoes. Awesome.
I finished up with an apple crostata, paired with an excellent grappa, and my Mrs. had the lemon curd and ricotta layered mousse.
I've had meals all over the world, and this was in my top 5 best meals so far. The ratings already reflect it, but this is a restaurant worth checking out more than once; we literally started planning our next meal there about halfway through this one."

"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elly S.","I really want to like this place. It's very convenient with a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and a variety of tasty food options. Both times I've been, the food has been slow to come out but this isn't usually more than a nuisance, especially on busy nights. However, on Saturday night my husband's order was lost/forgotten, and he ended up waiting about 15 minutes longer for his food - a large seafood pasta dish. They were very kind about the mistake and even comped a couple desserts. In hindsight, though, I worry that the staff rushed to make the food in order to address the error, since my husband has had symptoms of food poisoning since the morning after, and undercooked seafood seems a very likely culprit.
Again, I want to like this place, but I don't think we will go back. For those who do go, I recommend the tiramisu and would steer clear of any shellfish."

I enjoyed the burrata appetizer - it was my first time trying burrata, and I thought it was good (though I have nothing to compare it with). I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.
What stood out for me the most was Tim, who served us that night. He was extremely energetic, joyful, quick, and funny. He handled our large group with grace. I really appreciated the extra effort he put into giving us a positive experience!"

That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.
My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.
I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.
Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.
For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.
Overall, we would come back."

My sample space though is only the bay area, but San Jose's Little Italy restaurants can hold their own.
The novelty factor at Tavoláta is high, beginning with super-spicy Calabrian spice roasted pistachios and ending with hazelnut chocolate topped with the bitterest grapefruit marmalade you'll ever have. Get it while you can, when I tried asking for the marmalade's source they told me it's only temporarily on the menu.
And of course, if the start and the end are so good, how could they falter on the middle course? Main entreé was a cheesy sumptuous semolina ravioli delight, the Gnocchi alla Romana.
It would be worth coming back to Seattle just to eat at Tavoláta again."

The branzino was overcooked into a dry mess. Also pasta was inconsistent, varying from hard/al-dente to mushy soft. Only standout was the perfect lamb-mousse bruschetta.
Yelp pictures and trendy menu are deceiving. Happy hour prices for a quick bite/cocktail is probably fine. But for fine Italian dining, Tavolàta is just not there. I have high hopes they can work on consistent preparation as those guys in the kitchen seem like they are really trying."

Yes! Small restaurant so you need to wait for tables to open before being seated but service is quick upon ordering. Menuu is limited to three lunch entrees. They always have the bolognese and two specials. $10.95 each. Pasta is homemade. Today was Lumache with celery root in a pepper cream sauce and Lasagna with chickpeas, kale and tomatoes in a bay cream sauce. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not overpowering and did taste like red pepper. I'm a fan of vegetarian lasagna and loved this one. The blend of vegetables with the cheese was extraordinary. And yes, it was rich. We also ordered sides of focaccia (good-not too oily and perfect for dipping in sauce), kale salad (not a fan of Kale Salad but the dressing made this dish) and a Dulce de Leche shortbread cookie as we needed something sweet to complete the meal Total tab with tip for two was just over $40.

"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jan M.","We were in town for a long weekend, and our normal place, Tulio, was closed for renovations....so we needed to find a new Italian place to eat dinner. After doing a bit of research, this place seemed to be ideal, as it has a few fish dishes, some vegetarian dishes and looked quaint and cozy from the pictures.
Upon arrival, we were seated immediately (as we did have reservations). First impression overall was good - this place was busy and bustling with energy. I was excited to see several specials for the night, and three of them were fish! The wine list was also very extensive with Italian wines from all regions. We asked for a recommendation from our waiter, and we went with it. He was spot on with the wine - it was fantastic!
We started with bruschetta, which was fresh and not too garlicky, just the way I like it. My partner had the minestrone soup and said it was fantastic. For entree's, he had a basic pasta puttanesca and I ended up ordering the baked eggplant, even though the specials looked amazing.
Food arrived quickly, and I will say, the flavors were overall very good, but the eggplant was a bit odd. Usually this is served with eggplant cutlets, but I found that there was mostly the skin of the eggplant with very little of the vegetable middle (the meaty part), so it was a bit tough and not that enjoyable. I think I was just unlucky, but this is the reason I gave this place 4 stars versus 5. My partner really enjoyed his pasta.
Would I come back? Yes, but I still prefer Tulio and will return there next time I am in town."

The only thing that was worthwhile here was the oil for the bread! We asked for a second basket, that's an extra charge and it came literally after we had finished our meal. Our entrees came out SO fast they must have been microwaved, but one of our meals was barely warm! Lastly, we attempted to experience the highly recommended zeppole - not worth anyone's time or effort. Both the pastry and dipping were hardly considered good.
I had high expectations for this restaurant, and am truly disappointed it didn't satisfy. It also didn't help that a group sitting somewhat near us who were friends with the staff were literally yelling and laughing so loud I couldn't hear anything my partner was saying without having to repeat myself in a loud voice. Several groups around us were giving the table looks, as it was an obvious annoyance.
When it came time to use the bathroom, one of the two toilets was majorly clogged with lots of toilet paper, and the other had globs of wet toilet paper on the back portion of the toilet. Either way, it was undesirable to want to use and a rather easy thing to fix, something necessary in a busy restaurant to maintain.
The ambiance was clearly not fulfilled given the attempts. I would not return the next time I'm in Seattle."

It was a bit too strong of a flavor for me but I thought the other two pastas were very good. For $20, however, the portion size of the Gnocchi was extremely small. Another issue was the bread they served at the beginning was very cold. Not even room temp, but out of the fridge cold. We finished the meal with a tiramisu which was surprisingly pretty large! The dish itself was average-- nothing special really. Also, service was mediocre, the host wasn't super friendly and neither were servers. Overall, a pretty average experience."

It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."

My expectations were perhaps unreasonably high given the website's description of the chef's experience. The bread provided as a starter was neither fresh nor toasted.

Our server was more interested in high dollar tables where cocktails were ordered and it was difficult to get his attention. I had the pesto di pomodori secchi alla puttanesca and the anchovy smell and flavor overpowered everything else. I typically can't get enough pasta but could not finish this dish. My husband had the manicotti al forno and while it was good the walnut flavor was overpowering. The price of our meal was not commensurate with its quality. We've had cheaper meals that were tastier and higher quality. I wish we had skipped this place."

Their restaurant is a small space and being that they're only open 5-11pm, I'd recommend going during the week.
Their bread and dip appetizer is to die for! It's light and fluffy and appetizers set you in for the rest of the meal to come. My boyfriend got the Linquine con Gamberie and I got the Penne Pasta alla Vodka. Delicious, delicious, delicious. If you like everything with a bit of spice like myself, just ask for their sauce! Someone will come by and give you a teaspoon full of their secret sauce.
Customer service is great. The intimate feel of the restaurant is amazing. It's a great place to dine!"

"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Artemis L.","I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."

I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better)."

Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away"

We dropped in on a Wednesday for happy hour food/drinks (6pm). Loved the prices, but admittedly didn't love the food.
First, I will comment that prices are exceptionally good during happy hour. Also, their happy hour stretches a bit longer than most. From a food perspective, I wasn't in love with most dishes. Octopus salad smelled slightly fishy (possibly fish sauce?), and could have been grilled a little longer for my liking. Ahi tuna needed more flavour--salt or brine (miso/soy) would make this much better. Baked broccoli wasn't really baked, or not to our expectations (ie. crispy, crunchy). Gnocci with black truffle was my favourite. Lots of truffle flavour. Definite recommend. The clams in broth also lacked good flavour.
Ambiance is interesting. Dark romantic lighting, but music reminded me of a dinner club. More upbeat/dance."

We came here at about 7:30 pm on a Sunday evening, and the two of us were seated right away. The service was a little slow at first but it did pick up after we placed our entree orders. There was a bit of a mix up with our appetizer order, but we ended up enjoying the arancini (the one that was accidentally brought to us- we were not charged for this) FAR more than the bruschetta we ordered.
Just to get this over with: their version of bruschetta was honestly one of the worst things I've ever eaten. This sounds like I'm being dramatic, I know, but goodness what an odd flavor combination. I would not call myself picky and I'm able to eat pretty much anything people put on my plate, but this... was a no-go for me. We both felt bad about the mix up so we tried to force ourselves to eat more of the bruschetta but it was just so bad that I couldn't. Weird flavors, way, WAY too sweet for an appetizer. The only positive part of this dish was the bread it was on, but it was ruined by the sickly sweet reduction and the horrendous gorgonzola. People on yelp seem to really enjoy it, but I'm just here to tell you- it won't be for everyone. It's unfortunate because I feel like they could do a classic savory bruschetta beautifully, but I understand wanting to do something more unique, I guess.
The arancini was quite good, on the other hand. This was the appetizer that was mistakenly served to us (just to be clear, we pointed this out to our waiter and he asked if we just wanted to keep it- we didn't just dive in). Honestly, even though we felt bad about the mix up, we were glad it happened because of the whole bruschetta situation. This made up for the bruschetta. Our waiter described them as fried balls of risotto with fontina cheese and saffron. The marinara it was served on had a lovely, light smokey flavor. I'd order this one again.
The complimentary focaccia comes with olive oil and balsamic to dip it in. Every aspect of this was delicious. The olive oil tasted amazing. You could even do without an appetizer if you wanted to because of this amazing bread.
For my entree I chose the Sicilian pesto, which was in the seasonal section of the menu. At first I wasn't too impressed flavor wise, but then when I mixed the dish up a bit more the flavors were dispersed much more evenly. I ate the leftovers the next day and it was better after the flavors melded together more. Probably wouldn't order this one again due to how dull it was despite the exciting description. The entrees come with a starter salad, but you can substitute for another type of salad or soup for $4. I got the caesar salad. I loved it. It was beautiful- and they put anchovies on it which I personally enjoy. (Our waiter asked me if the anchovies were okay with me, so if you don't want them then you're able to omit them.) My boyfriend got the started salad, which he said was ""not that great."" The $4 sounds crazy, but the caesar salad I got was probably three times the size of what my boyfriend got. Also if you love caesar salad like I do then it's worth a try in my opinion.
For his entree he ordered the margarita and added the meaty bolognese. The rolled pasta was beautiful. The flavors were simple and tasty.
He doesn't like coffee flavored things or coffee in general, and I somehow persuaded him to try the tiramisu. He actually enjoyed it! The coffee flavor wasn't too strong for him, which he was worried about. I loved everything about the tiramisu and would definitely order this dessert again.
The service was a bit slow at first, like I mentioned earlier. But after we ordered everything was pretty efficient. Our waiter was really nice and didn't check on us too much or too little. The only thing that I thought was a little annoying was their ""no phone"" policy. I mean. I get it. You want to be the place where people talk to each other instead of looking at a screen the entire time. You don't want people talking loudly on their phones, ignoring the wait-staff because they're on their phones, or doing some other annoying crap like that. Understandable. I just find policies like this to be pretentious and try-hard. Just my opinion."

"Bizzarro Italian Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bizzarro-italian-cafe-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Katy H.","The olive oil here was some of the best I've ever had. The focaccia was also tasty, and was mostly just helpful in getting more olive oil into my mouth. You should check this place out for that alone.
The pasta special was good, and even the cheese sprinkled on top was notable. Sadly, the steak was too tough and a bit overcooked with an overwhelming parsnip flavor.
When paired with the nice service, fun decor, and creamsicle pannacotta for dessert, this makes for a nice place to visit."

They do a build your own style ordering. You pick a sauce and a pasta
Got the mushroom and white truffle sauce with fettuccine. I kinda wish I got it with the recommended pasta or was a bit wavy and curled which held the sauce much better than flat fettuccine noodles BUT it was much more al dente than the fettuccine. And I like my pasta soft.
Added the sausage to it but it wasn't too much of a difference. The sauce was so flavorful didn't need the meat."

This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."

I had hoped it would be outstanding as some of their reviews and certainly the prices suggest. The pasta dishes were fairly robust, though not super flavorful. Soups were pleasant if a little scant on ingredients. Bread was very good, though served with butter rather than olive oil and vinegar. Our server did the thing listing the dinner specials without mentioning prices, which always bugs me (it seems manipulative; you have to ask the price and feel like a cheapskate, or order and hope for the best while feigning wealthy nonchalance, or just avoid the specials altogether).
Tends more toward art food than a solid meal, not quite in the ""eat before you go"" category but leaning that way. Noise level was quite tolerable. A little too much reliance on salt in the dishes, though not terrible.
I'd go back but would not go out of my way to."

It wasn't a huge problem, though, because we were a party of two and they had plenty of seating open. We were seated at about 7:35pm and ordered at 7:45pm. We only ordered one appetizer and two entrees--the appetizer arrived about five minutes after ordering, but we did not receive the entrees for another 40 minutes. For a restaurant that was probably only about 40% occupied, it felt like an excessive wait. Also not sure if this was significant or not, but one thing we noticed is that each time someone came to take our order/check in on us, it was a different person each time.
Food: The food was actually pretty good. We got the focaccia for appetizer, and the gnocchi and the rigatoni.
Ambiance: Simple and elegant.
In fairness, I would give 3.5 stars, but the wait time for two pastas was actually pretty ridiculous. Even with the good food, I probably won't be back."

Upon arriving, the reservation I made through yelp fell through but fortunately we were able to get seated right away. My bf and I ordered a TON of things, our server (who was super nice and friendly) even joked around thinking we couldn't finish. If I remember correctly, we ordered the bruschetta, beef tartare, fries, and two pastas and drinks. The wrong bruschetta came out so we actually had two at our table. While I can say the appetizers were absolutely amazing, the pasta as okay at best. At the time, I considered coming back just for the appetizers.
Now why do I give my experience three stars? I woke up at 5am the next morning with food poisoning and again 3 hours later throwing up everything I had in my stomach. I've never had food poisoning before so it was absolutely brutal. Suffice it to say, my boyfriend ate all the same things I did and he was totally fine. The only difference was that I ate the carbonara and he had the rigatoni.
Although having a shitty experience afterward (literally), I would recommend this restaurant to others but not entirely sure I would come back."

Also even though he ordered well done patty, it was still juicy. Less so from the meat and more so from the amazing flavors, like the special sauce and thinly sliced tomatoes.

The employees are incredible. They are quick, remember faces, and are relentlessly friendly. You can tell that there are regulars who sit at the bar, who just treasure the experience of coming here. It's a really small menu and venue, but it's definitely part of the charm.
The ingredients are fresh, and they experiment with new flavors - all of them were good. I always went ""from the Garden,"" and was delighted each time."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashley K.","Utterly fantastic and a wonderful showcase of the market.
Came here for lunch recently with two others. We each had a different item and all of us loved it. I had the Ocean, someone else got the Farm and the third got the simpler pasta with marinara, parm and basil. Each one was amazing. The open kitchen gives you a front row to watch your food cooked while you wait.
The Ocean was a really well-spiced dish. Pasta in all three was cooked absolutely perfectly, tender but toothsome still.
The service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, and they run that place like a Swiss watch. Wonderful to see a kitchen running so smoothly and efficiently.
When you get your food, you can cram in the upstairs if there are seats, or join the mixed market vibes of the eating area down the stairs (just be careful carrying your plate!). Note, if you're getting wine (which I wanted to, but alas it was lunch on a weekday and I didn't want to fall asleep at work) you gotta stay upstairs to eat.
Would definitely come back for an early, early dinner with too much wine for a romantic market date night."

I don't come here as often as I would like because, well, weight. I always eat waaaayyyyy too much when I'm here. The hole in the wall aspect is nice and cozy, but I do wish they had an upmarket version as well so I could come here as a night out.
Also, I wish they would deliver with someone other than Bite Squad."

"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ryan T.","I'm so glad I found this place. It's small, but the ambiance and homemade food make for one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. Our server had excellent recommendations for food, including gluten free and pescatarian and gluten free options. In fact for gluten free options, many things on the menu including deep fried dishes and pasta, can be made without wheat to perfection.
Get a reservation or go early!"
"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rahul D.","Against my selfish desire to keep this place secret, I'm writing a public review of this place.
I have been here several times with varying party sizes and types (2, 4, 10, some vegetarians, some pescatarians, typical omnivores, etc.), for my birthday, parents' birthday, going-away parties, date nights, etc.
I have had the family-style serving every time (35 for antipasti, pasta, meat, and dessert!!). The staff is excellent at accommodating dietary restrictions that vary throughout the party, and their choices always satisfy.
The quality is always excellent, the service is always great, the drinks are always smooth and well-priced, and the value is always incredible.
I hope you all get to enjoy this small restaurant, be sure to reserve ahead of time due to limited seating."

"Aglio e Olio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/aglio-e-olio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin L.","This is my hands-down favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I live in Capitol Hill and the Italian places are nice, but they're a bit upscale and hit or miss as they try out the hottest and hippest ingredients on the market.
Aglio e Olio, however, I found randomly when I decided I needed a bite to eat and was in the area. It's a small intimate restaurant and I was thinking: ""Sigh, whatever. At least I can just get pasta or something.""
Wow. This place has hands down my favorite meatballs I've ever had in my entire life. They're huge, and they taste AMAZING. I've been going back more frequently now, and I also have to recommend the Calamari. It's not deep-fried, it's not crispy, but instead it's this AMAZING pan-seared quality. Please, please, please do yourself a favor and try the Calamari. Ridiculously good!
Anyways. I didn't realize I was coming into a wonderful small family-style and family-tasting Italian restaurant until I tasted the food, and at that point I realized I was in a good place.
I love you, Aglio e Olio! I hope you stay here for a very long time."

"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Corey S.","My husband and I visited Barolo for dinner with our friends on a Thursday night during restaurant week. It's a perfect spot if you're celebrating a special occasion; the low lighting makes it very romantic, and the food is high quality and prepared beautifully.
For our first course, three of use ordered the English Green Peas Puree' and Guanciale, which was rich, creamy, and probably my favorite item the whole night. I'm pescatarian, so I was delighted when they told me they could make any of the 1st courses vegetarian (they kindly removed the Guanciale). The 4th member of our party ordered the Speck And Mozzarella, Poached Pear (without the speck), and loved it as well.
For our main courses, my husband and I both ordered the Cernia alla Livornese with heirloom tomatoes and squid ink risotto, which was divine. We especially loved the squid ink risotto; I was worried might taste fishy, but it was the perfect texture and savory flavor. One of our friends ordered the Wild Boar Tenderloin Honey with juniper chanterelles, and he absolutely loved his dish! My husband had passed on ordering the boar because he was worried it would be too gamey, but it was cooked to perfection (seared on the outside and rare on the inside), and ended us wishing he'd ordered the same dish. Our 4th friend ordered the Raviolone with kale ricotta and local pumpkin puree and also finished off her dish!
For dessert, I was the only one to request the Torta Salame di Cioccolato, and it was amazing! The other three ordered the Cannoli, which I tried and enjoyed as well.
Our waiter was fun and friendly and joked around with whom I think must've been the manager, as he visited our table at some point in the evening.
I only have a couple small critiques; the first being that was a little loud and I had some trouble hearing my friends who were sitting right next to me. It also took a little longer for our food to come out than I was expecting. Both of these can be chalked up to it being restaurant week and they were serving a higher volume of people than normal (which is a good thing!).
Overall, I highly recommend Barolo for a high quality, fine dining experience!"

"Barolo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lexi H.","Ahh, Barolo. What a complicated relationship we have. How do you always lure me into your late night happy hour?
Barolo is - hands down - my favorite happy hour in Seattle. 50% off bar food with $20 bottles of wine (red, white, or rose) is an absolute steal. They also have an excellent wine list outside of the happy hour, but the $20 bottles are always nicely selected and good for table wine. Happy hour is 3 - 6 p.m., with late night happy hour 10 p.m. - midnight.
The complimentary bread with an olive tapenade is reason enough to come here. I don't know how they are sent tapenade from heaven, but they figured out a way to import it, apparently. Man, it's good.
BUT, here's the real reason I get drawn into Barolo: THE BAKED ESCARGOT. Not sure if you like escargot? Trust me, order it, because you will. You get 6 escargots (removed from the shell) baked in a little muffin tin-like ceramic dish, swimming in a delectable butter sauce. Perfect use for extra bread - eat that lil' snail and then soak the bread in one of those little slots full of butter-ous harmony.
Other favorites: the grilled calamari is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The cheese plate is a crowd pleaser, especially if you have a not-so-adventurous friend with you. All of the pastas I have tried will hit that carb-sized hole in your heart (and stomach).
The location is intimate (read: the bar area is small) with a dark, but upscale, atmosphere. I have always enjoyed our servers and bartenders; very friendly and chatty. Note that it is next to the main Amazon HQ campus, so the early happy hour is PACKED Monday-Friday, so arrive early if you are looking to go then. In the summer, the small outdoor area is buzzing with Amazonians in search of the city's best happy hour, so it can be difficult to get a seat.
5 stars for happy hour, with a solid 4 for the rest of the time (the full menu is tasty in itself, albeit a bit rich). Even when I promise myself I am going to try another happy hour, I end up here - and always leave so happy, full, and ready to come back."

The initial service is fantastic and the bread is to die for, however the pasta was overcooked, salad overdressed and the wait staff less than friendly.
Dessert yielded the worst semi Freddo ever. The cart concept is fantastic but fails to deliver on the food and ultimately provided an overall mediocre experience at a high cost.
I will not be returning here again."
"Carrello","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carrello-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nate H.","I'll be honest with you I wasn't that impressed just looking at the pictures of this place. It looked like a place where I would get a really small pasta dish and destroy my credit score doing so. Boy was I wrong... this place is fantastic.
Luckily for Carrello, my girlfriend convinced me to go to this place with her for our anniversary because she really liked the decorations (hanging plants bring the ladies in apparently). We were very impressed by the ambiance and the friendly service. You definitely get the chic hipster vibe when you're in here, so make sure you wear your finest beanie.
This place combines incredible pasta with a mini surprise dish at every turn. They give you a wooden block which signifies to the wait staff if you're in the mood for some Italian delicacies. As you're waiting for your dishes, they bring around all sorts of goodies from calamari, to fancy meatballs, or a massive tray of desserts.
The pasta itself made me want to kiss an Italian grandmother. We took the risk of getting a dish with tripe in it for the first time ever, and it paid off. I can't even remember what the name of the pasta was, but the blend of tripe and veal was so rich and creamy that I forgot I was eating a baby animals and stomach lining."

The pastas were fantastic as was everything else I ate. We ordered too much, as is our wont, and everything tasted wonderful. Everyone at Carrello was smiling, and this is a happy place to be.
The mother restaurant to Carrello is just across the street named Altura. It is a gastronomic destination with an expensive degustation menu. Carrello is the perfect counterpart, with its casual, boisterous vibe. Prices were reasonable but the experience made money irrelevant. A great time is priceless."

The lamb shank special was ""to die for"" according to my friend who ordered it (I don't eat meat). My penne puttanesca was spicy and bracing and packed with flavor. We shared bruschetta and a caprese salad that featured superbly fresh, amazing mozzarella (although the tomatoes were a bit pallid... I blame the time of year). A couple of our party ordered pizzas. One pronounced his ""just fine"" and the other (my husband) thought his was flavorful, but ""too bready."" He's from NYC, so he likes a verrrry thin crust.
Dessert was amazing: the four of us shared a regular and a limoncello tiramisu. Both were HUGE. Both were tender and fluffy and delightful, and neither were cloyingly sweet. The flavor of the liqueur and cream shone through.
WARNING: do not trust the prices posted online! Most items on the menu were between one dollar and four dollars MORE than the online price. We still got out of there for $250 bucks for 4 of us - including 1 1/2 carafes of their decent house Montepulciano and tip - but we were expecting it to be a tad less.
That said, I would return."

A cozy, welcoming atmosphere, similar vibe to a rustic country home in Tuscany. The service was excellent, courses served timely, and just the right amount of attention. The lamb gnocchi, while tender and well presented, was too heavily salted. My partner had the shrimp scampi, which we both agreed was also too salty and grilled shrimp slightly overdone. The last critique would be the cannolis we both had for dessert, which would have been a joy to my Italian grandmother had the chef decided to leave off the discordant note of raspberry drizzle. That said, the wine, coffee, appetizers, salads and service were superb. We'll try it again at some point and see how it goes."

Took a friend of mine who had never been and she was in love with the place. They take no reservations so you need to get here early or be prepared for close to an hour wait. Tonight they opened at 5, we got there at 5:15, being told already that there was a 45 minute wait. Fortunately, we got called about 20 minutes later. I ordered a cosmopolitan which was great and we ordered the calamari appetizer, I ordered the lasagna with bolognese sauce and she ordered the chicken parmesan. Because of the wait at our table for service and then for the meal, we got a complimentary salad which was very nice. My drink was excellent but then there was very little meat in the bolognese sauce of my lasagna and that's primarily what I was getting it for. Not only did the wait person take it off the bill, but gave us both complimentary desserts. I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Very small setting and very warm and cozy. Menu has excellent choices as well as the wine list and cocktail menu. This place is worth the wait!"

Wish they would especially for special occasions. When being seated ask not to be seated at the table near the restroom. Awkward when people are standing waiting to pee as you try to dine..and reminds you that you are near the toilet. They really need to eliminate that table. There is a little bar in back by little I mean it accommodates about 7 to 8 very tiny space. Again if you're not there at opening your wait will be over and hour.

I am normally critical of ""Italian"" restaurants and sometimes a glance at the menu will give me an idea.
In the menu we saw, Lamb is translated into ""Pecora"" which means Sheep. Lamb is ""Agnello"". One wonders why in this modern age, people do not use a proof reader or a decent translator. In any case...
We were seated by the corner window which offers the view of the sound and sunset. We were greeted by the kind owner, and served with fresh, warm, flavorful bread. I ordered an Italian beer and my friend a red wine.
We ordered the Calamari in umido and bruschetta as antipasto followed by Fettuccine alla Carbonara and Risotto Con Salsiccia e Funghi. I found the carbonara dry and bland, I couldn't taste the guanciale, nor the egg. My friend liked his dish. We did not have room for dessert, maybe too much bread...
Judging by the various reviews this place could be a hit or a miss. My suggestion is to go, perhaps not on busy weekends.
If you're out on a date or some romantic event, the table at the corner with windows facing the West, would be the perfect place to have dinner at."
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","R D.","Let me start by saying that this restaurant has a gorgeous view. It's a cozy family run place that serves delicious authentic Italian food and the service was excellent too.
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the owner / host and showed to our table. We started off with some complimentary home made warm bread. For appetizers we got the caprese buratta plate and mushrooms with polenta. For our mains, we had the prawns risotto and Pollo buccatini pasta. Everything was fresh and delicious. The food was rich, but I am not complaining, it was delectable.
Against better judgement, we decided to order chocolate tort to share for dessert, and I am so glad we did. The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the consistency of the tort was spot on.
Overall - delicious food, friendly service, and gorgeous view. Highly recommended!"
"La Rustica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-rustica-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mel S.","We had a late night dinner yesterday (Friday) night and I woke up this morning after the most glorious carb/fat-8-hour coma. The restaurant is cozy, the interior is dark and does its best old-world impression, but the food is delicious and the service is attentive.
Yesterday was a refeed day for me so I went nuts on carbs:
-bread: buttery, tasty, and addictive. If you get bread straight out of the oven and not overly baked you'll have to practice extreme restraint from eating the entire basket
-calamari to start was refreshing. It isn't your typical fried version. It's almost prepared like a soup and can be spicy depending on how heavy handed the preparer is with the spices so beware. I piled my Calamari on the bread (bc carbs are life)
-I ordered the sepia spaghetti special with seafood made with Alfredo sauce. I love Alfredo sauce but it can get sickening if you overdo it. I barely made it through half my dish (bc I was carbed out and I wore tight jeans) but I'm convinced that this dish is amazing. I was disappointed in myself for not finishing the entire thing but I did my best and my husband will now get to enjoy the leftovers today (today is not a high carb day).
-husband got the Manfredo gnocchi (which isn't traditional gnocchi FYI). He loved the lamb but wasn't impressed with the non-traditional gnocchi.
-we also ordered a half carafe of wine which paired well with our meals.
No desserts were ordered, unfortunately. My pants just wouldn't allow it.
We will definitely return. I was told they take reservations for large parties so I plan to bring my family here for my brother's graduation!"

"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brooke L.","I am writing this review after many many transgressions with this neighborhood establishment. If you ask.. why did you continue to go to this restaurant if you have had numerous bad/awful experiences, there are only two reasons: one, some of the service staff were amazing; two, proximity to my house. To be honest, the food has always been mediocre at best and the restaurant is so poorly run that it's a 50/50 chance that you will have cold food, bad food, or an awkward run in with the owner and his ""managers"".
Over the last ten years, I have had my wedding rehearsal dinner there, hosted large birthday parties, assisted in a large wedding reception, and recommended friend to do the same. With the exception of my rehearsal dinner, every event has been tainted by large mistakes, hidden charges, and general dishonesty. Last Friday, I hosted my husband's 40th Birthday, mainly because of the easy access for my guests, and also I thought by ordering family style and an open bar would be hard to mess up. I was wrong. They insulted my guests on many occasions and gave us 1 member of their staff for a group of 30 people. This staff member worked so incredibly hard at serving, bussing, and bartending it was impressive. However, it made the experience feel stressful and rushed. I made the best of it because I didn't want to ruin such a monumental party with our closest friends, but I left with a bit in my stomach about how everything had gone down. Most of all the treatment of my guests. It was embarrassing to say the least.
I will NEVER return to this restaurant for dinner, and I recommend at the very least, you should avoid having any of your treasured life time events at such a mismanaged place.
10 years of keep their lights on at times, is over."

Unfortunate to pay $50 for this meal, and honestly dissapointed in the yelp community. There is no chance this place is 4 stars. Y'all need to tighten it up.
Only positive is the outdoor seating area.
Will not be returning."
"Ristorante Picolinos","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-picolinos-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tracy J.","Wow. How do I describe Picolinos ... I have spent so much time at this restaurant with my family for quiet celebrations or to have a cup of coffee in their European style coffee nook.
Piccolino's is an extremely large brick building in a quiet Ballard neighborhood. When you walk in it is quite dark. The tables are set with heavy silver. The tables are dark wood, And restaurant is split up into 2 or 3 different dining areas which gives it a cozy, intimate feeling. There's also a full service bar.
But my favorite place to go is the outdoor patio in back of the building. It's a huge outdoor patio. It's also landscaped as a garden. There are potted plants everywhere and draping vines and flowers. I've never seen another outdoor dining space in Seattle that is so beautiful. It's like having dinner in someones garden. There's also a tented outdoor seating section with a Moroccan feel. Dark drapes and very spacious. If you can't decide if you want to dine inside or outside, that area would be a great compromise. At any rate, wherever you sit it will be an experience. As for the food, I would take the rating down to 4 stars. I haven't had anything on the menu that I really loved. The foods okay. I think their menu could be reworked to provide more vegetarian options. But we don't go there for the food. We go there for the atsmosphere."

Waiter didn't take food orders until we had to walk up and ask for them to take it. Seated at 7:30, food order taken at 9:40 after reminding the server twice!! They misplaced the orders and came back 30 mins later going around the table telling them their ordered dish was no longer available. Guess the table next to us ordered and had the last plate ahead of us. The bill was never updated so we still payed for the original stuff. If u have a party larger than 2 avoid this place."

"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dave C.","So very glad this outstanding restaurant has settled into the historic Homestead Cabin just off Alki Beach.
We've had three meals now, no easy feat given the intense demand for reservations since they opened last summer. They all were among the very best we've had in Seattle. The pasta dishes change frequently and are all beautifully textured and popping with fresh fresh flavors, perfectly sauced. The antipasto are mostly light and bright; I have no idea how they source such extraordinary ingredients in the dead of winter. And the primi & secondi are all prepared so perfectly (so far) - the ribeye with a light, crispy crust containing stunning fatty bursts with each bite - the lamb beautifully prepared with the most delicately fruity/minty sauce - the black cod or salmon also beautifully sauced.
Service is elegantly casual, and the selection of wine is wonderful. Cocktails are also so well prepared.
I have no idea how this place is rated only 4 stars - this place is of the caliber of Salare, Cafe Juanita, and Canlis."
"Il Nido","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-nido-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joline T.","TL;DR Chef makes the simple things shine
Reservations: Seriously prohibitive and a pain. Reservations are open 30 days at a time. Reservations open at midnight. Had to book a month out at 12:01 am.
Parking: There's a lot right next door to the building. Signs will say parking for Homestead only; that's for Il Nido at the Homestead.
Burrata and prosciutto: Burrata was incredibly fresh and light, prosciutto was beautifully delicate and perfectly salty paired with the fresh burrata. Hands down the best prosciutto I've ever had.
Tagliatelle with bolognese: Tagliatelle was a little more al dente than I've had at other places; I loved the chew. I hate to compare it to Il Corvo, but how do you not? I also haven't been to Il Corvo for a couple years now because the line is impossible now. Based on my v distant memory, Il Corvo was just as good for half the price. But since I can't get Il Corvo anymore, then I'll pay for chef's pasta at Il Nido.
Cauliflower steak: it was fine. Gorgonzola was an interesting pairing that I've never had before. Gorgonzola wasn't overwhelming, but it was too much for me. That's a very personal taste thing though.
Pork cheeks with dried pear slices and polenta: Pork cheeks were didnt-need-a-fork tender. The sweetness of the pear complemented the earthiness of the pork cheeks. The polenta was the best I ever had. Crispy on the outside, fluffy soft the inside. Nice cheese flavor without being cheesy.
Would def come back!"

"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ellen B.","I've only been to Artusi for brunch, but I'd love to return for dinner too. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at brunch. I wouldn't recommend Artusi for large groups- but my friends and I always do it anyways because we like to suffer and wait for tables. We had a table of 6 and we all opted for the Special $30 two food items + cocktail pitcher and split them amongst two people. I'm not sure if this is designed for one person to have two dishes and a cocktail pitcher or for two people because the dishes are just a tad too small portion wise for a good meal. However, the bonus of a cocktail pitcher for only $30 total makes up for it. Most brunch places in Capitol Hill will be $15 for your meal + $11-15 for ONE mimosa on top of that so this is one of the much better value places in my opinion. The risotto and the hash are my favorites so I'd highly recommend those two.
We all ordered different cocktail pitchers so we could try them all. However, the waitress was adamant that the cocktails needed to be served in the correct glasses and that we couldn't share because it wasn't possible to pour them into other glasses. So... we did it anyways behind her back. That was kind of a weird experience, but the cocktail pitcher experience was fun and we all enjoyed ourselves.
Overall I can't wait to return to Artusi for brunch again and also to try dinner!"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Daniel L.","Decided to try this place for happy hour on a weekday. Food is tasty but very pricy with tiny portions. Cost $5 for a single meatball, $12 for about 10 pieces of mini-ravioli. And the drinks are good but nothing special at high prices. Wouldn't recommend for happy hour as they didn't have good deals - it might be good for a date night though. We ended up going to another place after spending a lot of money here without getting full or drunk"
"Artusi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/artusi-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","JT T.","Artusi is definitely worth a visit for its pasta nights: 2 pastas (there are usually 3 or 4 on the menu) and a bottle of house wine for $40. This is a fantastic deal for the neighborhood and for the regular prices (~$20 for a pasta alone) at this establishment. That said, pastas (and all the dishes I saw) are pretty small, so order an appetizer or two if you're a normal amount hungry. The food itself is really nicely prepared and presented; everything was cooked well and had a good balance of flavors. Restaurant/bar is fairly small--for groups, I don't think they could seat a table of more than maybe 6-8 people--so go early on busy evenings (Friday through Monday)"

While dining here most recently (about a year ago) Chef Pisano was in the dining room, I asked him whether there was a chance of the dish coming back ... I was surprised at the curt response ... no, our customers want healthier dishes ... really? Several items on the menu have butter, cheese, cream or crema sauces ... it's okay to good-naturedly say we want to change things up. Gotta be honest, it was a bit of a bummer interaction.
The sweet potato gnocchi used to be pillow soft but has been overworked and a bit tougher/gummier the last 2 times I've ordered it (the executive chef at Marco Canora's Hearth in NYC taught me how to make gnocchi and it's easy to overwork the potato dough).

Based on our experience I wouldn't recommend Tulio for anyone celebrating a special occasion. Our server ignored the table for most of the evening and was extremely inattentive. The bill included a $39 charge for several glasses of the ""complimentary"" prosecco that was brought to the table when we arrived. After pointing this out it was removed from the bill but it just one of several oversights by the server, including a fly in my spouse's coffee to end the evening. The food was fine but I felt like they could have cared less about our table or the occasion. I would strongly discourage anyone from spending your special occasion here."

While this could've been an honest mistake it really felt intentional from his behavior and lack of surprise or apology when I pointed it out. Really sketchy/rude if you ask me.

"San Fermo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-fermo-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Arielle F.","I want to eat my last meal at San Fermo and I want it to be their bolognese. Seriously, this place is amazing whether you are going on a date, entertaining out of towners, or just in the mood for a delicious meal.
A few tips:
1. Always start with the bread and salted butter.
2. Order the burrata.
3. Order the bolognese.
4. Eat EVERYTHING! (This goes without saying.)
If the patio is open I highly recommend sitting outside - it's magical with fairy lights strung all around and there are heaters and blankets if you get chilly. However, they also have multiple beautiful spaces inside so there's really no bad seat in the house.
My SINGLE criticism is I've tried a few of their desserts - most recently the goat cheese cheesecake and a panna cotta drizzled with olive oil - and I haven't been especially impressed. To be honest I don't usually make it to dessert here anyway so it hasn't been a huge issue for me but if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend checking going elsewhere (Ballard is FILLED with great dessert spots, I recommend Hot Cakes)."

The food was fine, not amazing, not terrible - unremarkable and overpriced. I don't mind paying $$$ for really good food but this was just not it.
The service was sub-par - maybe because our server was new (she wasn't knowledgeable about the menu) or maybe because they charge an automatic 20% service fee so there's no incentive to provide great service - the tip is guaranteed.
The worst part? The hostess, Meredith. From the first unwelcoming interaction when we arrived, to the last when we were leaving, she stands out as the low point of this entire mediocre experience. Meredith was so incapable of handling a ""stressful"" situation of people backing up in the waiting area that she lost all grace and was completely rude to her guests . Just a reminder to Meredith - you're not saving lives, you're seating people at tables. Get it together.
With so many other great options in the area, don't waste your time and money here."

That being said, I have to admit I really did love this place. First things first, this place is really quite expensive. The pastas are easily $8-10 more than other places that also offer handmade noodles and sauces. However, the place is super cute (ideal for date night) and each room feels unique. The service is warm, kind and extremely helpful.
I really did love the quality of the pastas and sauce. The bolognese was great. I've had a lot of truly great bolognese and I really enjoyed this one. The dungeness crab bucatini was exquisite. A lot of seafood pastas will overload on garlic or cream to mask the not so fresh seafood but this let the crab shine. It had the right amount of lemon, butter and crushed black pepper to make a perfectly simple yet extremely delicious plate of pasta.
Also, I need to mention the Caesar salad. Wow. I love Caesar salads and I appreciate when they are anchovy forward (it is a fishy dressing, afterall). This was perfectly dressed with a wonderfully salty, fishy, anchovy-y dressing that will leave me thinking about it for some time. One of my favorite Caesar salads in the city, hands down."

"La Vita E Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-vita-e-bella-seattle-7?osq=Italian+Food","Kayla K.","I'll start off by saying that the food was good.
However, everything else was not good. I asked the server his preference between two pasta dishes. He suggested one over the other, so I ordered that. Our salad came out quickly, and then the entrees took forever. We were all very hungry by the time our entrees arrived, about 30+ minutes later. The entree given to me was not what I had ordered. It wasn't even the other pasta dish I had asked about. I told the waiter this and he begrudgingly took the entree away. It was not what I had ordered, why is that my fault? I thought that they would hurry to make the correct entree, but I was wrong. My family finished their meals and then my food was given to me. At this point, I had waited an hour total for my entree. I asked the server for pepper flakes, he never came back with them. I had to ask two more times before they were brought to me.
Then, the receipt came. We were charged for the incorrect entree that they had initially brought out to me. The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to fix the receipt. They not only tried to charge us more than we should have paid, but did not apologize once, or comp anything for the inconvenience. Not even my $3 soft drink.
A sorry would have gone a long way in this situation, but it never came. The whole time I felt like I was the one at fault. We will not be returning to La Vita E Bella."

Our waiter was juggling multiple tables but knew how to handle it. When he felt he wasn't visiting us fast or often enough he'd do a drive by and update us on where we stood. That small gesture makes the difference. My wife and I just took the time to have a great conversation about our vacation in Seattle.
Once the food arrive it was nothing short of AMAZING!"

Food was very tasty
Ambiance: terrible, my eyes are really bad, and the place is just too damn dark, I cant read the menu. Had to open my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. The pizza was good, but the sausage could have been more.. it was just sprinkled with a few shredded sausages... was just in the center of the pie.
Overall was good. I'd come again, but next time I will try to request to sit outside patio. 3 stars for now, I'll change my rating next time I come back."

Upon entering, I was in awe of its decor and atmosphere. My friends and I didn't order any drinks, but it seems like their drink selection is pretty vast and reasonably priced. We each ordered a pasta, which was on the smaller side in terms of portions. The pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and the noodle to sauce ratio was pretty good. We also ordered an appetizer to share (the risotto balls), which was only okay. The risotto tasted more like thick white rice.
Service was good as well. Great place to check out if you're not too hungry and looking to catch up with friends and/or have an intimate date night!"

I had my birthday here this past weekend and after confirming 3 times over the phone on where we would like to be seated, we didn't get the table we had requested and they put us on a table for 6 when the reservation was for 8 (the server did acknowledge that the reservation clearly called out the specific table we had requested). The way we were now seated, I had one friend just sitting by himself cut off from the rest of us.
Our server was rude and just not mentally present. Our drinks took forever to come, I had to reorder my wine twice since the server was spaced out. They even picked up my pasta before I finished it- by far the worst service I have ever received. All of us agreed that we would never return to this place."

The food was bland and nothing special, and the service didn't help either. The arincini was really disappointing - it didn't have a crispy crust and tasted like plain rice, no flavor or seasoning whatsoever. I also had the grilled veggie salad which tasted fine but it wasn't anything special. My friend had the bucatini, which apparently was good but not great. Portion sizes are on the small side but I think the prices reflect that. Prices are pretty low for the location and ambience (the decor was nice) but you can get way better tasting food for the same price elsewhere.
Our server was dismissive and cold from the moment we walked in to when we left, which didn't help the mediocre food. Would not come back."

My sister quickly shut up once the fork of pasta was in her mouth. The food spoke for itself. Didn't need to be anything fancy, sit down, or Michelin-rated...the pasta was so dang good it was in a category of its own; let's call this category ""Ain't 't Gotta Be Fancy To Win Mouths.""
Seriously, get anything off the menu, it's all delicious. Even the salads are awesome, if you're not a salad person.
Highly recommend. Not sure if Grassa is owned by SA aw company, but both are similar. Grassa is in PDX."

I looked over their wine list(very fairly priced) and ordered the wine pairing for the 14 course tasting menu. The wife and I loved the balance in the menu starting out light and working its way to red meat. No course was too heavy on meat or seafood, and every flavor blended in perfectly within each course. Service was better than amazing. The chefs were personable, and I was gifted extra rounds of drinks. The wine selection inspired me to buy a bottle to take home. The Italian love put into the food made the course structure worth it. At the price we paid, we felt that the food was a steal. We will return 100%

"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Reza A.","My wife and I don't usually do fancy dinners out, so I'm by no means an expert in the finest cuisine. But we had a special occasion to celebrate and decided to give Altura a try. And given the hefty price (dinner for two was $500 with two glasses of wine and gratuity) the most important question I can help answer: Is it worth it? And I think the answer is a resounding yes!
The service was excellent, but I think that's expected. What was less expected was the ingenuity of the courses, the wonderful taste, the fact that we had to make almost no decisions other than provide our dietary restrictions and preferences and were very positively surprised with every meal that was brought out.
Make sure to make reservations at least a few weeks ahead of time and don't be shy to share all your preferences when you make your reservation (they are very nice about avoiding things you can't eat). If you forgot, that's ok, I had forgotten to let them know to avoid dairy when I made a reservation and o lot told them during our visit and they did a great job to accommodate the courses.
Great for a romantic dinner for two but we saw larger groups with up to 6 people and they seem to have a great time.

"Altura","https://www.yelp.com/biz/altura-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stella D.","The creative ideas and the ambience and customer service are exceptional. No condescending look if you don't want wine matching. Very swift and punctual throughout the dinner. But do expect a 2.5-3 hours dinner since waiting for food just takes a while.
But the taste of the food have big swings among the dishes.
For $137, we get about 8 appetizers, 5 entrees and 3 dessert. Out of 8 appetizers, there are only 2-3 that actually taste normal. Some of them are way too salty, some of them are just a combination of weird flavors. I don't even know how you can make food taste so bad. The conclusion I get is they are trying too hard to be creative. It ended up the ones that have simpler ingredients actually taste the best... Even though they might look the most exciting.
The 5 entrees are generally pretty good. The celebration of winter shellfish is good other than the clam is not salty. The Gnocchi is amazing to smell and taste since we sat at the counter. The steak is definitely a highlight. The quality of phenomenal and it is cooked to the optimal tenderness and flavor. No wonder no more entrees after the steak.
The dessert is okay. Liked the bourbon caramel semifreddo the most but overall a bit too sweet. It was my birthday so they used the chocolate sauce to the draw out a happy birthday message on the last dish which is cute.
Overall good experience will recommend it for special occasion but definitely not coming back."

Pros:
1. they have a nonalcoholic pairing option, which is very friendly for drivers.
2. most of the dishes were super great, and we found many of them having interesting and also enjoyable tastes.
3. service was good and very quick.
Cons:
1. I ordered their 4oz wagu steak. The steak is definitely not the top grade that would melt in your month. The taste is closer to the Australia wagu (they said the steak comes from Hokkaido). Also there were some vessels in the steak which were hard to cut. My mother had the dry aged duck. I also tasted a small piece and I felt it was a bit over cooked and dry. I don't know if it is potentially related to its dry aged nature. But in general I feel the main dishes (both beef and duck) were the least impressive ones in the whole course.
2. I asked for a table, and they placed us at the corner table which is right below the stairs. It was noisy every time someone used the stairs. There were planety of other tables empty but I don't know why they put us at that particular table."

Great cozy restaurant and their service was fantastic. Small selections of wines but they were really good wines and reasonable.
Ordered A charcuterie plate, fried oysters, burgers and mussels. The plate was so tasty and the meats were perfectly cured, their mousse was just melt in my mouth.
Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.
Fried oysters were my fave. Small size and sweet. Everything we ordered was just divine. I would go back there for HH next time. Sooo laidback vibes and the foods were excellent!!"

So many fun drinks and yummy snacks. They have one of the most extensive cocktail menus I've ever seen and it was hard to decide on just one (okay, two) to try. For snacks we had the fries which have a great balance of salt and dress black pepper and the crispy pig skin which came with a fantastic aioli.
We arrived around 5:30 and were able to get a seat on their small patio, but the inside looked nice too if the patio is full."

We also ordered the Mezza Plate, which was hummus, tzatziki, watercress & shallot spread, dolmas, feta cheese, grilled pita, cucumbers and house pickles.

It was the first time for my friend and I and she got the ""Forager"" and me the ""Sweet Potato."" We both really enjoyed our dishes minus a temperature issue. My potato dish was scrumptious but lukewarm. If it was piping hot and service wasn't excruciatingly slow this place would definitely get four stars. Our server disappeared to go on a smoke break, never offered another glass of wine after the first and pretty much just went on his merry way. I understand that Solo is very chill and laid back but a little more service and we'd be in the four-star zone."

Don't people want somewhere nice to have a drink and a snack before the ballet, or the opera, or other evening events? It's a mystery for the ages, but I'm pleased to say that Solo Bar has become a dependable, if quirky, happy hour spot in Lower Queen Anne.
I'll be the first to admit that the space feels a little strange when you walk in. The tables are oddly far apart, there's a low stage with a couch and coffee tables that juts into the room, and some more awkwardly low couch seating in a corner. It definitely feels like a wall was knocked down to join two separate spaces, and some odd partitions and internal walls remain, which break up the room strangely. If the weirdness is too much, just sit at the bar, which faces away from the room and its distracting use of space! Most of the tables are small four-tops, so it's easy for staff to push a bunch together for a large group (as we were the first time I was there).
Happy hour goes until 6 pm and has some solid deals: $4.50 wells, specialty cocktails $4-6, and a small selection of wine by the glass, $5-6. There are a few discounted happy hour snacks, too, but I encourage you to check out the regular dinner menu, which is pretty affordable ($8-16) and offers a nice variety of comfort food classics. The lamb meatballs are a shareable appetizer or a good-sized entree for one. My dining companion really liked the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But the Waldorf quinoa bowl is filling and tasty, and doesn't feel like a sad diet-food sacrifice! There are also some soup and salad, mushroom pate, and veggie pasta options for vegetarians, and gluten-free options.
The specialty cocktails are surprisingly affordable even at regular prices (most are $6-8), so it's no biggie if you miss last call for happy hour. I like the Paper Plane and pear collins, and they have several Moscow mule variations that look intriguing. There's also a short list of nonalcoholic drinks, including cold brew and a virgin pear collins, for you designated drivers.
Service is friendly and welcoming, although it can get scattered during peak times, so you might have to tag your server if you need to get your bill in time for a show. The atmosphere feels casual and relaxed, not pretentious or hipstery at all, and it's often surprisingly chill during happy hour, so don't worry about popping in by yourself for a quiet drink. Solo is quickly becoming my Seattle Center-adjacent go-to bar!"

I had the butternut squash pasta, and the cocktails are exceptionally original and tasty.
I'm leaving three starts because the actual service experience was very difficult. I had to perform a block away at eight, and needed to get there by 7:45. I ordered my food at 6:25, and it didn't get to my table till 7:10 (just one bowl of pasta) I asked for my check when the food was brought, because I knew I had to HURRY and things were very hectic in there, and the check was wrong, and because it was at this point impossible to flag down the waitress, I had to go to the bar and stand in a very long line ( like 10 people long) and wait quite a while to have the check fixed, and to pay and leave.
This was all because the place was PACKED for a show, and they only had one waitress on staff, to serve the entire restaurant AND bar.
She was absolutely doing her best, getting everything done as quickly as possible and remained friendly, even in the face of a bad situation. But this was my first time going there, and though I loved the food and drinks, the hectic and tense experience makes me hesitant to go back, but I will maybe give it one more chance, because the chef, at least, is doing something VERY right. Still, the owner needs to adequately staff this establishment."

It has a funky atmosphere.
Nice happy hour menu; it has something for those who are watching their diet and those who are not. Truffle popcorn is fabulous. The mixed nuts have a Sweet covering. The dates were warm and stuffed with goat cheese. Wonderful hummus.
The salads are nicely done without too much dressing. Try the lamb meatballs and salivate. The burger was cooked medium well, but was not over done.
The cocktail menu is small, but good. I like the wine and beer menu. The prices are very fair. The service has been wonderful.

BUT IT DOES!!
It's one of the few places left in the city where you can get a cocktail you know someone thought about and put love in to creating without breaking the bank. Most cocktails are around $8 (cheaper during happy hour) and for how delicious the food is it's very moderately priced. Their menu changes with the seasons so I can't say I've tried everything, but I've tried a lot of things on the menu and I've yet to taste anything I dislike. Some of the dishes are very light and health conscious and some are rich and filling, but it's all yummy.
During the day they keep the place pretty lightly staffed so if you're looking for speedy service I'd suggest walking up to the bar.
One thing to be weary about is there's A LOT of events that go on the the area (the ballet, concerts, theater, etc.) so if you happen to go on a night that coincides with one of these events just make sure you plan for a wait on food, it's a small kitchen and they're doing their best but it's hard to keep up when the whole city shows up at one time."

After a friend's recommendation, we stopped in at about 6:00PM after a SIFF film. No tables were occupied. A young guy was cleaning up two tables. We asked him if there was a food menu and he plopped a couple on a table and walked off. He was mixing drinks at a fairly quiet bar and NEVER returned to our table for drink or food orders. We left after about 10-15 minutes and I'm sorry we waited so long to leave. The menu looked good and we had decided to have some dinner and beer and sangria. I don't know why we were so rudely treated but suspect that we did not meet their customer age criteria (We're 68 and 72). It was absolutely not busy; we were the only guests seated at a table and since the guy gave us menus, it was definitely dinner time. Will never try that place again."

The bartenders are the best. They have great listed cocktails and I've had them invent a new cocktail on the fly. If the place isn't super busy, they will interact with you making you feel really comfortable.
The bar is built around the cocktails and the bartenders. The decor is okay for my tastes.
The place can be too small at times so great for a romantic stop but a large party might have to wait for a large table.
If you want more than bar snacks, skip this place but come back after you had food for a great time."

Belltown has some amazing cocktail lounges already, so Roquette is up against some stiff competition. I might be back for a date in the future, but with Rob Roy, Mr. Darcy's and Branchwater a stone's throw away... maybe not.
The drink I got (think it was called Madame Derrier? Something bitter with whiskey) was indeed amazing, but spendy, even for Seattle. Date's drink was also good. Both were nice 'n' strong. But again, there are tons of great options around.
The inside of the bar is very dark, but somehow missing that coziness I expected. Maybe it was just because it was a sparse night...
The service wasn't great. We sat at a table near the window, away from the bar, and the server kept coming over to us (just have been half a dozen times, maybe more) to ask how we were. Each time, we were fine. I got the impression they wanted us to leave or order another drink or food, and we just didn't need it."

Prices: expensive
Service: shitty, hostile
Bar was empty when we came in. A number of us were meeting up at the bar. Table ran out of chairs so we pulled some of the bar stools for our friends (remember empty bar).
Lady told us we couldn't use the stools because it would block the ""aisle"" and would be a fire hazard. Fine, returned stools.
Friends stood around the table and lady came back and said we couldn't stand around the area because it would still block the aisle and still be a fire hazard. There was a corner area that opened up and she suggested we sit there.
Corner area was large, was not next to any aisle, but still did not have enough seats (poor floor management, there's 8 of us), and bar still empty. We pulled some stools cuz we figured no fire hazard. Lady said she we couldn't use the stools and wanted her stools back.
Friend mumbled a complaint and lady goes on a power trip, flexes that she has the ability to kick us out. We weren't loud, rude, or belligerent to any degree. We barely finished our first round of drinks. Whatever... we decided we didn't want to stay. Slammed our drinks and scrambled to get out of there.
Don't worry lady, I won't come back. I will take my yellow ass and green backs somewhere less hostile.
Btw, bar was still empty when we left."

French-Polynesian influence without going the way of a tiki-bar, the drinks are inventive and balanced. The menu will grow with time -- I believe it's been open less than a week -- but I was able to try their 47 Monkey Vesper, the white Negroni, and a TBD spirit-forward Mezcal cocktail (a creation of barman/designer Kyton). Each featured layered flavors that are perfect for the Summer.
Design-wise, the place is intimate but well lit, and the walnut accents and eclectic wallpapers throughout make for a fun backdrop.
Don't miss out on the hot chicharrones. And I think I heard something about about Bugles and caviar..."

"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Derek R.","I don't know what happened last night, but we'll never be back. Had an 8pm reservation. After being seated nothing happened. No one said a word to us. No quick hello. No drink order. No ""be right with you"". Sat there until 8:15, and this place isn't that big. I know 15 minutes doesn't sound like a long time but when you are just sitting there in a tiny room, believe me, it is. Started to get worried that no one around us had food. When I thought a server was finally coming to us she stopped at a table next to us that had been seated at least 30 minutes and asked if they were ready to order. Nope. We had a show to go to and this almost hijacked the whole evening. We left.
By the way, quick note, take this as you will. A young poorly dressed couple came in when we were waiting. Like, girl was wearing a Rugrats T-shirt. They looked scruffy but seemed like a nice couple looking for a date night. They asked if there was a table available and the girl said no, fully booked all night. Literally a minute later a better dressed older couple comes in, asks same question, gets told there's a 20 minute wait. My wife and I were like ""hmm, that just happened"". I imagine some might like they do this, protecting their otherwise nice ambiance, but watching it happen was off-putting to us."

Our server, Ray, was attentive and friendly. He seemed to genuinely like his job and even took time to talk to us about Seattle and give us some tips on places to check out.
The restaurant is definitely a small hole in the wall but the decor is nice and the tables were cozy without being cramped.
We started with the calamari which is served in an amazing pesto sauce. I had their fettuccine ai funghi. If you like mushrooms I'd definitely recommend it. My boyfriend ordered the tortellini in a meat sauce. It was yummy and super unique."

Family of four and every dish was incredible; even the plain old cheese ravioli - has a perfect sauce that takes it to the next level. Not a white table cloth, upscale place but that makes it feel better; like Itialy, you feel
loke you could get a bottle of vino and just eat for 45 mins on the amazing food while chatting with friends (or strangers at the next table). Wine pours were very generous and while it wasn't a typical name brand wine list the wines were very good. Outdoor seating wasn't available but I could envision amazing ambience if it were. Wait staff was very helpful with my teenagers that asked lots of questions, I felt like they wanted you to have a great experience.
Will be back for sure."

"La Fontana Siciliana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fontana-siciliana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Scott D.","In the pantheon of Italian restaurants in Seattle, this gem, just a stone's throw from Pike Place Market, is often overlooked and under-rated.
La Fontana Siciliana is a great example of understated elegance, from cooking to serving to the atmosphere of the place itself. Here you'll find true Old World Italian cuisine served by an impeccable waitstaff in a place with warm ambiance that is both comforting and elevating at the same time.
Pasta dishes are excellent, as are their entrees. Some highlights: Fettucine ai Funghi, Fettucini del Bosco, Pasta con le Sarde, and Pollo Marsala. Their risottos are also excellent.
La Fontana Siciliana is ideal for romantic casual dining, spending quality time with good friends, or before/after a concert or movie close by. Highly recommended for the cuisine, the service, and the atmosphere."

"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Viraj H.","Beautiful place with great food and execution! Cantinetta is a charming little place in Wallingford, which has managed to keep its character over the years.
Went here on a Saturday evening, and thoroughly enjoyed our experience, everything from the decor to service to the food.
The restaurant is beautifully designed, and gives a classy vibe. The ambiance is dark, but could get a little noisy on busy weekend nights.However, it's a perfect place for an intimate date night!
Though the place is pretty large, its popularity keeps it pretty packed, and I wouldn't recommend heading there on weekends without reservations. When we went, every seat was occupied, with more diners waiting to be seated.
Our group got a good variety of food, almost all of which was great. The arancini appetizer was perfectly made, and the focaccia was the best!
Among the pastas, we were blown away by the risotto, but I felt that the tagliatelle was very heavily salted, and didn't enjoy it as much as the other food.
The zeppole was really well made as well, a perfect way to end a meal.
They also have an amazing wine list, and we split a few bottles, all of which were great.
The service was pretty good too. It did get a little slow but with a packed house, that is expected. Our server kept checking on us pretty often, and they had a few other people refilling beverages which helped.
The prices are as expected for a place of this caliber, a little higher than the neighborhood pasta-place. But with the quality of food and service without the pretentiousness, it's completely justifiable.
This is a must go place in Seattle, especially for celebratory night outs or simply date nights. Definitely recommend!"
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nelson F.","I think this was my third time there, but I never wrote a review before now.
We arrived a bit early and sat at the bar and had a cocktail while waiting for our table to be ready. The bartender was very busy, but kept checking on us.
Our reservation time came and went, but the hostess kept us informed about what was going on. (The party before us was just taking their time after dinner) No problem, we weren't in a rush.
We got to our table and were introduced to our server Katie. She was great! Very fun, and knowledgeable about the menu.
I was torn between the cacio e pepe tagliatelle and the truffle risotto, and asked if I could get a half order of each. She said they don't do that, but spoke with the chef and was able to put some truffle on the cacio e cepe. It was actually a really good combination!
For dessert, my wife and I split an order of zeppole. 4 balls of warm, gooey, sugary goodness. Two with pistachio sauce, and two with nutella sauce.
We joked that the zeppole was the only reason we were there, but everything we had was excellent.
Cantinetta is part of our regular restaurant rotation!"

The homemade bread they serve is awesome and is dense and flavorful. For our mains we had Cacio e Pepe (which I'm sad to say tasted was more like fettuccine Alfredo with black pepper) and the sausage and gnocchi (which was good!). The star of the meal was the Panna Cotta (dessert). Not a dish I would think I'd ever get all that excited about but holy moly was it good. I'll be going back some day just to eat it again."
"Cantinetta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Geoff P.","About three bites into our two entrees, I turned to my date and said: ""This could be the best Italian in Seattle."" By the end of the meal, after I ordered another (second) pappardelle to share, I was convinced this is the best Italian in Seattle. We had a bottle of Barbera, which was also divine. The one weakness, if any, was the appetizers. The dates wrapped in pancetta were divine, however.
The highlight was the pappardelle, no doubt. Show-stopping. I'll be back to have it again. Probably within the week. Outstanding food, great service (they were busy), and a great atmosphere for groups of 2-4.
Overall 4.8/5 with the lack of versatility among appetizers as the only weakness."

I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but never got around to it. One thing to know about this place is it's literally located in a neighborhood, so do not be fooled when looking for it.
I quite like the decor at Cantinetta. It's rather rustic, and perfect for a night out. The servers are extremely friendly. It was a little busy, despite it being around 5:30. The bread is soft, and served with a fragrant olive oil.
Alex chose a flank steak for dinner, while I went with a black pepper tagliatelle. Alex's steak was resemblant of carne asade, and was served with (according to him) a yummy blackberry jam and fingerling potatoes. My pasta was tossed in a cream sauce with pork cheek, peavines, then topped with an egg yolk. Personally, I thought my pasta was a bit salty for me, but with the bread, it was fine. I absolutely adored the pork cheek because I am a big fan of pork belly. The peavines were a nice addition to the pasta. The pasta was cooked nicely, but I would've preferred maybe a little bit more al dente. Alex seemed to enjoy his steak, and said he would come back again for it (he's picky about steak).
Definitely check this place out!"

"Rione XIII","https://www.yelp.com/biz/rione-xiii-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Camille J.","My boyfriend and I stopped here for a late dinner and were pleased to find that their kitchen was still open at 10pm. We got the chicken liver mousse bruschetta to start and shared the bucatini and fennel sausage pizza. He got a whiskey sour with egg whites (extra $2, though he thought it was worth it to take the drink from $9 to a reasonable $11), and I got the Sicilian bramble, which was just a delightfully refreshing drink. Nice and fruity but not fake tasting - an ideal balance.
I loved the bruschetta. First of all, it was served with 4 large pieces of fluffy bread. The bread was perfectly done - crisp crust that wasn't so hard it would cut the roof of your mouth and soft inside. I usually expect some measly little crostinis or small pieces of baguette at nicer places like this. To match the thickness of the bread, there was a thick layer of mousse on top as well, making this actually quite a large and filling dish.
The bucatini was a little too al dente for our taste, and I typically enjoy my pasta al dente. Just maybe a wee bit less al dente. The sauce was good though, albeit a little salty, especially considering how salty guanciale already is. When we finished the pasta, the waitress suggested that we keep the leftover sauce to dip the pizza crust in, and my mind was blown. I feel like it's usually the opposite situation - where I want to keep the sauce on the plate but it's swept away before I can say anything.
The pizza was also a hefty serving. The sausage wasn't too salty and was very tasty. The crust was a little soft, but overall the pizza was delicious. We were both very happy with the meal, the service, and the restaurant overall. They also had a great playlist going on."

We also tried the fresh beans with ricotta and pistachios, and fried artichokes - both were delicious. The salad was a large serving of very fresh greens. Even with all that, we also ordered a dessert to share. I can't stop talking about the warm pumpkin cake with spiced pecans, sauce and ice-cream. We all went nuts. And it was large enough for all five of us to have a couple of bites each - all we could manage considering the feast we just consumed. The service was as good as the food.

We got the fried artichokes as an appetizer. It was solid and the aioli was pretty good. For the main dishes we got the hot coops pizza and the carbonara. The pizza was wood fire and delicious. The toppings went well together and it was a good size for one hungry person or two to share. The carbonara was excellent and a huge portion. The pasta was cooked al dente and the egg yolk on top made it even creamier and elevated the texture. It definitely could have used a little bit more salt or seasoning, but it was still delicious.

Went last night for the first time in about a year (after tossing in the towel) with some friends who suggested it ... we hoped that things had improved. Nope.
After waiting at our table for more than 10 minutes, we finally asked a passing employee whether we had a server and she my goodness has he not been by ... nope. She then at that moment kindly took our drink and appetizer order.
Our server showed up with the wine and made no apology or any acknowledgment that he left us hanging for so long at the outset. He then proceeded to be snarky throughout service.
Wine was fine. Artichokes were over salted and had very little pangratto. The fried risotto with beef ragu and mozzarella was good.
The winter squash ravioli downright bad and was sent back ... predominantly muddy flour water taste ... bizarre for a dish of the type I order frequently.
Both the carbonara and cacio et pepe pastas lacked flavor and tasted watered down. The guanciale in carbonara was chewy, bloated and unrendered.
The Amatriciana pasta was good after a friend doctored it up with her own calabrian chili oil for more flavor.
Ordered baguette with olive oil after an extended discussion with server about whether we wanted focaccia ... focaccia arrived anyway ... didn't see the bill but we indicated we didn't want it and they told us to keep it anyway ... too much honey in the butter according a friend who tried it.
Much better Italian in the area ..."

I reserved a table in advance. Dinner was delicious and this review is about the SERVICE.....because it was SUBPAR. Our waitress, named Stephanie was unfriendly, lacked customer service skills or even normal people skills and just seemed to be annoyed or just didn't want to be there....
Our table is a friendly, happy group...not demanding or mean and we all have a lot of grace when it comes to others.
Her attitude made several of my guests uncomfortable and her lack of service was obvious to everyone because it was discussed later.
Our bill for our dinner was SUBSTANTIAL and we left a very gracious tip...even with the poor service, which honestly I should have reevaluated the amount we left.
I know that when I go out for a meal I want great service..that's why we go out...for the experience and I don't want to cook! I expect to feel good at the end of the meal on all accounts.

To be clear since we didn't catch her name, she was the bartender with the palest skin white sleeveless blouse and the most tattoos. Given the fact we had the best long weekend in Seattle that we could hope for, we had to overlook this person and her terrible attitude, or else she would have ruined our entire trip.

Food took some time but the bartender was prompt. Both charcuterie and pasta had plenty of seasoning. A bit too much spice and garlic. But that's a matter of preference and not a lack of food quality.
Nice ambiance, open late. Would like to check out their live music one night."

"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cassidy G.","We've been twice now and absolutely love everything at Raccolto. Even with a reservation you may find yourself having to wait for a bit as it's a small space and they're always busy, but it's definitely worth the wait. Both times we've come we've ended up getting seats at the bar and having a cocktail while we wait for a table and the drink menu is always fresh, creative and delicious.
We got the steak tartare both times because it's that good; don't skip it, just order it and be happy.
This place does all fresh pastas and damn, they are delicious and noticeably better than anything you were planning on making at home instead. Could go on and on but just know this: everything we've had here is worth the cost, the wait, and more.
Finally, excellent service both trips in seal the deal. Our server last time in was so knowledgeable, friendly, nice to chat with and even comped our drinks for no apparent reason other than maybe because we had to wait a bit for our table. We love it here and will definitely be back again and again."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michelle D.","I'm a fan. The small shareable plates at Raccolto are excellent. I have literally enjoyed every single thing I have ever tried here. And that says a lot, because I don't like a lot. The cavatelli pasta ... yes, please. Always a must-have. The service is knowledgeable and warm without being intrusive. The location on California Ave in West Seattle has given our neighborhood it's first real contemporary Italian option. Helpful note before you go: The restaurant itself is small. There is a counter bar in the back I have sat at once, but otherwise always been seated in the main space and it's just not big and not cozy or warm. More like open and bright. Make a reservation on Open Table or call ahead. Most of the time you don't need to do that in WS, but here you should and you will get right in.
Now the negative. Despite liking the food and all, I'm giving them 3 stars for two reasons: 1) a couple years ago I wanted to have my office holiday dinner here. Tried to set it up way in advance. They were SUPER rude and dismissive. That alone kept me away for almost a year. 2) Came by once with friends when there were tons of tables open and they were weird and wouldn't seat us, saying they were booked. That's fine, but major attitude. We went and ate down the street and walked by to the cars two hours later and the same tables were open ... they didn't turn over. After these two incidents I almost never wanted to come back. But after some time I did. And it's good. I still won't be a regular given the above, but at one point I would have written a one star review (after someone was a massive jerk when all I wanted to do was spend thousands of dollars for a dinner party and rent out the whole place) and swore I would NEVER go back ... so the theme of this review should be ""forgiveness"" and a hard-earned three stars that is a testament to the great food."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Bree S.","We came here a few months ago and it was 5 star perfection. The brussel sprouts, the burratta, the chicken. Amazing. This time was disappointing, but for the amazing pasta, which is worth the trip, despite the missteps.
There were serious timing issues that ruined the flow of the evening.
We made the mistake of going ahead and ordering food before drinks arrived. We waited over 20 minutes for drinks. Appetizers came before the drinks and were piled onto the table before the drinks even came. Then we waited an hour for the rest of the food.
The chicken was NOT the chicken we had the last time we were here. It was fatty and very salty. A lot of waste.
The cocktails were stirred in dirty shakers. There were multiple flavors in the drinks and when it was brought to the attention of staff, they were defensive and refused to mix a new drink, clinging to the claim that we didn't know what we were tasting. The waiter served the drinks with his fingers all over the rims of the glasses. He carried the drink in dispute back and forth from our table to the bar 3 times. No apologies or offers to mix a fresh drink in a clean shaker. It was awkward and instead of refusing the drink, we just relented. So disappointing. Instead of insisting on being right, why not just mix your clients a clean drink?
We loved this place when we came in October. Perfect timing. Very low key gracious service.
Don't know if it was an off night or if this is what to expect going forward.
Don't like to express disappointment in my own neighborhood, but for the premium prices we should expect premium service and quality of food.

We started off with bread and Brussel sprouts - the first bite was good but after that all we could taste was salt.
After waiting for awhile (and watching a larger group that came in well after us get their food before us) our two pasta dishes finally arrived with apologies for taking so long. The rigatoni was topped with pork and kale - I guess I didn't expect to see salty pork carnitas on top of a bed of over oiled/buttered noodles.
Pesto bucatini lacked flavor outside of the flick of the wrist of salt that was on every.single.thing.
Spent $100 (only one beer in the mix). Would have been fine if it was worth it, but so frustrating when it's not."

We each ordered pasta dishes, as well as coffee, wine, bread and a nice corn dish.
The problem was the pasta- their specialty. My husband ordered tagliatelle with crab meat. The pasta was cool to the touch; not even lukewarm. The crab meat in it was cold. Not cool- cold. The server couldn't have been nicer. She took the tagliatelle off the bill and comped our Americanos, which I appreciate.
Mine was barely warm enough so I went ahead and had it. Flavors were excellent, good sized portion. However, it sat uneasily in my stomach for a very long time afterward.
This is a gorgeous charming expensive place. They need to get their kitchen in order. Don't worry about seeing us again, because you won't."
"Raccolto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/raccolto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","T O.","I've been eyeing this place for awhile and finally got the opportunity to go here this evening with family. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, clean and simple. Here is the run down of the experience:
Appetizers: Down right the best part of the meal. Loved the flavor profile of each of these dishes and I would have been content with just eating this alone.
1) Burrata with olive tapenade and crostini's.
2) Charcuterie - Salami, watercress and a sweet whole grain mustard with crostini's as well.
Pasta: Unfortunately, the pasta had a lot left to be desired.
1) Rigatoni - Braised pork, kale and parmesan. Was really bland and watery.
2) Bucatini - Pesto, tomato and parmesan. Was really bland and watery as well.
3) Strozzapreti - Bolognese and parmesan. Was the best tasting pasta dish of the evening, but lacked a good punch in flavor.
Drinks: We ordered a black manhattan and shared between us. Loved the flavor profile of this drink.
Service: The gals working tonight were attentive and very nice. Unfortunately, our main sever for the evening needs to not assume things. He was really trying hard to make the sales pitch to my family elders and pretty much focused on them. Seriously, treat us all equally, instead of sucking up to the people you assumed were going to be paying the bill. The look on his face when he realized he screwed up when I gave him my credit card to pay the bill was picture worthy. Also, we indicated that this was our first time at this restaurant and I stated I'm a regular at GH Pasta Co, but he spoke to me in minimal words that this place is not the same and much more upscale. Ummm... ok. There was no need for that pretentious vibe.
Overall, I say stick to eating the appetizers and having a drink here. If you want pasta, seriously go to GH Pasta Co. in downtown Seattle. Owned by the same chef and the pastas are fabulous! I'm hungry just thinking of the super flavorful pasta dishes one can get there.
Note - The bar is small and if you want a table you'll need to have a reservation. If you don't have a reservation, look on their online reservation service for availability as there actually might be a table available sooner then what the hostess will indicate to you in person."

It was my first time visiting and I was excited to see what the hype was about. The atmosphere was great, perfect for a large party or an intimate date night. The vibe was industrial chic in a loft setup, very open and welcoming. The cocktails and appetizers were delicious and came out fairly quickly. For my main course, I ordered the tagliatelle with crab, and I have to say I was very disappointed. All I could taste was butter. It had absolutely no flavor at all, and very little crab for an additional $8. Luckily, I tried my boyfriends meal which was the chicken rigatoni, and my sisters which was the halibut and both were flavorful and much better than mine. I am thinking I maybe just selected the wrong entree, but should that even be a thing in a restaurant of this caliper?"

We have been coming to MM regularly together since 2012, and my wife has been going there since they were on Roosevelt long before that. Tonight was the last straw.
Perhaps they have changed management or been sold or something, but the food and the service have both degraded significantly over the last 18-months or so. The food was once good, and we left satisfied, and would take our leftovers home if there were any. Sadly our favorite dishes which we have ordered consistently are now rarely impressive and sometimes just bad. We often leave saying - wow that place has gone downhill. At least until tonight anyway.
The last time we were at the restaurant, we sat in the bar for happy hour and our waitress berated the bus boy so badly that we felt the need to pull him aside separately and give him a cash tip and tell him we thought he was doing just fine. She blamed the fact that no one had contacted us for 10+ mins on him and trash talked him to us after he gave us water.
Tonight we stopped in for dinner and were sat promptly, nobody contacted us for a solid 10 minutes, and when someone did, they apologized for the wait and took our drink orders. Another 15 mins later they brought our wine and took our dinner orders. Eventually when our food came out we had been sitting at the table for 5 mins shy of an hour and the food was warm (not hot) and my wife's bucatini was AWFUL. The meatballs were legitimately bad. My pizza was acceptable but was not cooked as well as I would have hoped, warm, but mostly undercooked. It took another 10 minutes of waiting before my wife went to the host stand to get our check.
It's unfortunate, but after having eaten there consistently for years, Mamma Melina will no longer be considered when we choose a restaurant to eat dinner or to recommend to friends."

Wines by the glass are very expensive for what they are, offering wines with long names from obsure winerys from other countries is deceiving to me, especally if they are cheap varietals being passed off as something special.
They poured a huge amount of sediment in one glass of ours, it was a terrible turn off and a sign the person who poured it did not know what they were doing or did not care if they served the dregs of the bottle to a customer. Who does that?

"Mondello Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mondello-ristorante-italiano-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Rebecca R.","Came here with a Groupon still on the hunt for a go to or even return to Italian restaurant in Seattle. The staff was super friendly and observant. Food arrived promptly. No problems with front of house service.
My order: Insalata Cesare, Fettuccine con Salsiccia, and a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for my meal and then tiramisu and a cappuccino for dessert.
The highlights of the evening for me were the wine, tiramisu and cappuccino. The tiramisu was lighter than I expected (perhaps more whipped cream or whipped egg whites to zabaglione and marscapone than normal) but the flavors were SPOT on. Seems from the other yelp reviews that the dessert are on point, so props to whoever is making those.
The salad was ok; not bad but also not super memorable.
The pasta was the real challenge for me. I enjoyed the sausage and the general flavor profile; however, the pasta was extremely stodgy. Some pieces of pasta were cooked differently than others and not all of it was even fettuccine (I think some linguine snuck in there). Overall the cook was way off to the point that I just ate the meat and a few bites and openly welcomed the arrival of dessert.
All in all, if I was in the neighborhood, I might stop by for some wine, tiramisu, and coffee and there is a slight chance I might try a different type of pasta, but this is not a place I would take my family to or go out of my way to return to."

After visiting various Italian eateries, Mondello offers an authentic homemade pasta that takes me back to my time studying abroad in Italy.
I'm shocked there are not more reviews about this place! Mondello is a great date spot and a good place to take visiting family and friends.
The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is a hidden gem in the neighborhood. If you're in Magnolia for dinner - this is the place to be. I always order the Ravioli Marsala, it just melts in your mouth with each bite. I've also had the gnocchi and it's AMAZING! You just can't go wrong!"

We were able to look past their fairly regular service blunders and mishaps, and the fact that the red wine was always served at 85+ degrees because we still felt welcomed and the food was plentiful and the quality was high.
But, after eating at Mondello a week ago, they have lost us. The family has faced the very sad loss of their matriarch, and the eyes on this restaurant now have a very different arrogance and focus on cutbacks for their own benefit. The place now feels like another manipulative Seattle restaurant taking sneaky steps to give you less for the same cost which will backfire as the experience and food quality has massively suffered.
We were made to wait for 10 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. A pack 'em mentality. Newly implemented, bread is rationed at one piece per customer and refilled for a charge. Red wine is still served too hot, yet the price per glass probably exceeds the value of the whole bottle. Portion sizes have shrunk, now 5 ravioli where there used to be 6 and they taste nothing like they used to. Veal has been replaced with bread in the no-meatballs. I mean, come on! Isn't that like the oldest trick in the book?
It is so disappointing to see how greed has messed with was used to a pretty good thing."
"Mondello Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mondello-ristorante-italiano-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Kati P.","Well....the service was very good. The homemade bread was unusual and very yummy.
The menu was very NON-CONDUCIVE for vegetarians. There were only two items on the entree menu and both were cheese-based. It's 2019 folks......there should be MANY choices for vegans and vegetarians.
The establishment was kind enough to make both of us a simple pasta dish with lots of veggies. We both asked for marinara sauce and our dishes came without any sauce, but rather in a clear 'soup'. We asked for sauce and a very watery and flavorless sauce arrived.
Both desserts we wanted were out, which was very sad. Why are they on the menu, if they're not available?
The biggest shock was the bill. We were charged the same price for our veggie pastas as dishes with meat or fish. Who charges $52 for two simple pasta dishes with no animal protein? Ridiculous.
We will not be dining there again. We have Italian restaurants much closer to home with rich red sauce and prices that are reasonable.
We felt very ripped off."

Primarily pasta but homemade pasta it offers up fresh versions of favorites. My son had venison meatballs and I had pasta puttanesca. We shared an octopus appetizer that was incredibly tender. My only suggestion would be to offer some shrimp as an addition to the puttanesca.
The restaurant is charming and on the small side, but we will be back.
Visiting my son in Seattle three things are always on the agenda: dim sum, seafood and Italian. All three difficult to impossible to get in Flagstaff so we are two for three so far with dim sum and now Italian."

This was one of the only places open in the area during the snowstorm. I'm so happy it was because I had been wanting to try this place forever and it certainly lived up to (even exceeded??) my expectations. Such amazing pizza (comparable and even BETTER in many cases than pizza I've even had in ITALY!). The service was also amazing. Our server was really friendly and she even RUSHED OUT into the snow after we left to hand us our to-go box we had forgotten at the table. What a SAINT!
5 of us came in and got 3 pizzas + 1 calzone. We got two that were recommended by our server (Dante and Fratelli di Bufala) and then also the Salsiccia e Friarielli. All of them were made of the same amazing dough that was crispy on the outside and CHEWY on the inside. The tomato sauces were killer. So flavorful and just the right amounts of it. I liked all three pizzas we got, but I think my favorite was the Dante for those bursting tomatoes, prosciutto, and arugula. I loved them all though, I don't think you can go wrong with the pizza choice. The via tribunali calzone that we got was pretty good, but not a classic calzone that you'd think of -- it had a lot of spinach in it and had no sauce, only cheese. Still really good though! This is also one of those places that has you cut up the pizza yourself with scissors. I am all about that!
The space itself is cute and has a nice vibe with candles and nice music. I will absolutely be back!"

Unfortunately, this place has some kind of sewage/cleaning/I dunno what problem. It stunk to nine hells. No one should be allowed to sit in such a toxic environment.
Our sense of taste relies so much in our sense of smell that they are inseparable. Even if we could somehow stomach the overriding scent of sewage long enough to attempt to eat, I highly doubt we'd be able to even remotely attempt to enjoy what might otherwise be a good pie that deserves a fork and knife.
This place might be worth it. The tables that were in front of the wide open windows were reserved. Maybe those people know the secret that others may not, this could be secretly delicious. But holy shit, who would ever eat with the smell of raw sewage overpowering every other sense?"

We were working next door at Neumos and with downtime before the show we went on a ""hunt"" for the nearest clam pizza, which ended up being right next to us here at Via Tribunali; we glanced at the menu while smoking spliffs outside. We got our fancy clam pizza togo and ate it dirty style in a small underground greenroom. We inhaled it but i do remember everything about it being perfect: crust, sauce, cheese, & clams.
Sure the box it came in was mad problematic, but hilarious at the same time. I'm sure the boys in the greenroom after us got a kick out of it. I only wish they'd objectify men the same way and have a buff man with a substantial bulge protruding from his tight pants, holding a pie :)"

However I have to say the pizza's were not great. Good but not amazing. I wanted to love it but the first thing I noticed is that our two pizzas were not the same consistency. One was perfectly round and the toppings were relatively consistent across while the other was all weirdly misshapen with toppings erratically thrown around so that not all bites were equal. Some had toppings, others nothing. Even worse it looked like a child made it and for $18 that is just not right. I also don't care for the scissors to cut the pizza myself. I prefer it cut before being delivered especially considering its damn hot. Flavors were good but I just cant get over the one pizza (carbonara) being so poorly made. Also I am not a fan of chili infused olive oil. At least warn us my poor wife was dying. Service was good but not much was explained about anything such as the spicy olive oil vs the other on the table we didn't even realize was there. For the price, I would rather go to Tutta Bella. Great crust though. The place has potential but my first experience was a let down."

Spinach risotto with three large shrimp. The dish was smaller than I imagined as it was $26. To be honest, it was average at best. While the shrimp were good, the rest of the dish was bland and left me still hungry. We decided to skip the dessert after be underwhelmed at dinner. Possibly, I ordered the wrong dish?

To simply call this an ""old school"" Italian restaurant doesn't do it justice. It is old school in classic, sophisticated, but unpretentious setting. Even more so in the service, and how the owner and wait staff will treat you like you're an old friend of theirs who has been frequenting the spot for years even if it's your first time walking in.
But the food is something else entirely. Not only do they nail the classics (including the best chicken piccata you ever tasted), they're inventive enough to keep up up with any Cap Hill or Downtown joint you see on a Seattle Times best of list. Try their wild boar ragu if you want a perfect example.

My Florentine risotto was an unusually small portion of risotto that was blandly flavored. The presentation was pretty, with three large shrimp and an orchid on top, but not enough to justify the price tag. The chicken piccata sauce was creamy, which is another odd choice for a traditional dish. The Alfredo was good, but our server forgot to add the shrimp, meanining it arrived 5 minutes later on a side plate looking somewhat sad and dejected, with no presentation.

Yelp has listed ""not recommended for large groups"" and I definitely agree- but that hasn't stopped our friends from choosing Bar Cotto. They always do their best to accommodate, but it can be a little bit of a wait.
I had the Night in Parma and enjoyed my drink- although I think it was a little light on the alcohol. My boyfriend had two cocktails that were heavy on the alcohol so I'm not sure about the consistency of experiences here.
It's a nice cozy place that we've enjoyed eating/grabbing a drink at. It's classier and not as grungy as most of the bars lower on the hill. I don't like pizza (weird I know), but I find Bar Cotto's pizza some of the preferable kind. It's not overly greasy or cheesy and I like the unique toppings.
My favorite here is the Brussels sprouts though. I don't like Brussels sprouts at all, but something about these actually made me unable to stop eating them! I've also tried the meatballs and would stay away (kind of bland and flavorless). Their appetizers are a little on the pricey side, but I think their pizzas/pastas are pretty reasonably priced for the amount you can get and share.
Overall I've had great experiences here and would recommend it if you're in the area. I'm not sure I'd recommend walking all the way up the hill for Bar Cotto from the main downtown area, but it's a great stop if you're headed that way anyways."

"Bar Cotto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-cotto-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kendra S.","Revisited Bar Cotto for dinner tonight. Ordered the Salsiccia Pizza, Ceasar Salad, Meatballs & wine. The 1st wine was a recommendation from the server, which was a white burgundy that went well with all of the food.
The pizza was amazing and might possibly be my new favorite Neoploitan style pizza on Capitol Hill. The meatballs were so zesty #loved. The Ceasar Salad could have been passed on. It was overly drenched in dressing.
The service was great. Had the opportunity to have a lovely chat with Brandon the owner and I will be back.
To reiterate I loved how zesty the tomatoes sauce was on the meatballs and pizza. So many places have bland tomatoe sauces and that's no concern here."

It was kind of on a whim, after a long drawn out conversation about where to go for dinner, we remembered there was that pizza place around the corner we'd mentioned wanting to try.
We just missed happy hour, unfortunately, as the HH prices are really solid and the regular menu is a bit on the pricey side.
We each got a cocktail (midnight in Parma for me, love the gin/lambrusco combo), then bruschetta for apps, and two pizzas (the A&O and the funghi).
Cocktail was great, just what I needed after a long day. The pizza was really nice, love that thin, tasty crust. The funghi is very subtly truffle-y, just the right amount. Honestly, though, the bruschetta was banging and I'd come back just to eat that.
That amount of food was perfect for two hungry people and the service here is nice, too. Ambiance is perfect for a date night as well."

My girlfriend friend and I are pretty and snobby about our Italian food (being from the NY area). This place does not need to be graded on a curve.
We shared the arugula salad, suppli, burata, and clams. Maybe one dish too many but would not have been able to skip any of them in retrospect. And to make my gluttony worse, I could not get the ""polenta cake with gold pear"" from the dessert board off of my mind...so I indulged. I rarely order dessert but am so happy I did...tears of joy well up remembering it.

The atmosphere is casual and feels like a bustling neighborhood hang out. They have some outdoor seating in the front and the back, perfect for Seattle summers.
We ordered the Salami pizza, Vongole alla marinara, and the Arugula and frisee salad.
Everything was delicious! The pizza was incredibly thin, perfect char, and amazing ingredients. The clams were made with fresh tomatoes and came with the perfect assortment of breads to soak up the yummy sauce in. We were impressed by the salad because we make a very similar one at home... but somehow theirs was ten times better! It was perfectly dressed and balanced and the ingredients were super fresh.

They don't even know what salt is here at BDC! I'd argue that they don't know what flavor is either, but that may be a bit harsh, plus I'm only 1 opinion.
We ordered the meatballs along with a margherita pizza and despite appearing delicious they were both MEH -- nothing special, almost bland! Very disappointing because I've never encountered such bland Italian food. I'll say though that the pizza crust was nice and thin and crisp, but the taste of charred crust was really all I tasted, and not because it was overpowering but because the sauce tasted like only a whisper of marinara.
There are much better Italian eateries around. Try Cascina Spinasse or Pizza Credo."

Consistently great food, fun drinks menu, friendly service, great ambiance and a place to run into your neighbors. As the neighborhood changes and provides a larger restaurant mix we're more apt to find ourselves seated next to someone who has ""traveled"" from Madison Park or Belltown because BDC's reputation has spread, and deservedly so. The owners remain present and engaged, keeping the quality high. They've created a great menu, which is broad enough to offer something for most everyone, but small enough that attention to detail remains. Last night's squash blossoms were amazing, as was the cucumber, sun gold tomato and Burrata plate. So glad we managed to save room for the Affogato for dessert. Another lovely evening."

Five stars, because we are loyal customers and the only complaint we really have is:
1) The Burrata & Eggplant Caponata - it's so incredibly sweet you cannot taste the eggplant. Eggplant & burrata are STRONG ingredients that can usually stand alone as the sole focus of a dish. Unfortunately the only flavor we picked up on was balsamic.. :( please bring back the old burrata!
2) The baked cod in place of the cod fritters. Not great, and needed a bit more salt? And a touch too greasy... again, please bring back the old fritters! They're too good!

It also came with really well grilled bread. The bread basket was the same bread but without the nice grilling. I was so confused with some taste in the bread but I realized it was the olives that were in the bread. Wish it didn't have that. Partner thought the bread basket bread was too hard, particularly the crust. And it wasn't as nice as the grilled bread that came with the clams.
Also ordered a cherry blossom drink which was average. Didn't really taste like a cocktail but just the prosecco."

Good drink/wine selection (but I don't consider myself any good at wine selection; so darn confusing so I tend go by the recommendations and the length of wine list.
Varied selections for dinner, lots of options. Had the crispy octopus, and it was actually tasty (my first time); had the salmon and it was pretty good, had the meatball appetizer and it was awesome, and also had the lasagna bolognese and it was large enough to feed a trucker, but was really good, and I took it home. my buddy had the rigatoni , which had some spicy sausage and he ate it all up, looked great.
tried a dessert called the chocolate budino, and it had some very subtle flavors; maybe a sophisticated pudding.

After I was finished with my work I sat in the bar and looked over their lunch menu. I really had a hard time trying to decide but it came down to the lasagna or the meatball sandwich. The bartender told me the lasagna was her favorite of the two so I went with it. It was much better than I expected and was comparable to my homemade lasagna. Even though the lunch portions are ""lunch"" size it was almost more than I could eat. I was glad I didn't go with a salad or garlic bread because I would have definitely over indulged. The only let down was I was so hungry that I forget to take a picture to post here. If you're in their neighborhood stop in for lunch.
I can't say much about their family style dinners since it's been so long. It was always a fun atmosphere with a small group and a great place to feed teenagers. It sounds like that part hadn't changed."

Bucca di Beppo Customer Service, please don't lie in Yelp saying that you are concerned. I've already send a message using your website, already called Seattle restaurant manager 3 times, already gone personally in the restaurant once. And I just don't get my refund. Really, you guys have my contact, as I said I've already contacted you many times."

It's not fun. It is cheap and sad, like going to a matinee in the mall. The food really sucks . Did I mention it is sad. It's just corporate garbage food. Just go to Olive Garden and save yourself some money. There is no charm or character to this soulless establishment, it makes me want to start planning my funeral."

First- get an early reservations. If you get a reservation after 7pm you will likely have to wait 15-30 minutes for the prior table to finish their meal as guests tend to linger and the service is on island time.
The salads are good, the veggies they use are very fresh. The entree's were forgettable, if not offensive. I had the pork entree and it was reminiscent of a Hungry Man Chicken Fried Steak, at $34, you can see how I might be a tad underwhelmed and even offended. My dinner date stated his meat dish tasted like a fancy Hamburger Helper. Another diner in our group had the squid pasta, which must be for an acquired taste as no one in our group was a fan.
I would come back for the wine, the cocktails and the can't be missed deserts as long as I had a reservation that began before 6pm to be sure I could be seated in a timely manner. For dinner, I guess it's an acquired taste, but we weren't digging it."

La Medusa is a quaint staple in the neighborhood. Weekends are hard to get a table but worth getting on the list or make a reservation.
The food is simply delicious. We had the aracini and beets to start, so good. We ate them too fast. The bread , I assume is from Columbia City next door, you get a variety of their delicious breads.
We had two pastas, the spaghetti and meatballs , wow! Simple fresh marinara sauce and unforgettable large meatballs. The meatballs is tops , tender and full of flavor and not salty, I asked the server what the recipe is for the meatballs and of course she smiled and wouldn't tell me.
We had the squid ink spaghetti vongole , so good again subtle flavors , perfect clams.
We had our third course of the veal shank and polenta. We did not leave anything , plate empty! We like to compare how veal shank is prepared when we travel so La Medusa is succulent and tender and not salty like some I have had.
The dessert course is never to be missed at La Medusa , Pana Cotta is exceptional, we had the chamomile and honey water one, omg we wanted another. We also had the pistachio cannoli , you have to ask why aren't they bigger?!
The bottle of Italian Valpolicella was perfect with everything we ate, so order a bottle and relax and eat some good food!"

"La Medusa","https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-medusa-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Robert B.","Very good, well-established Italian restaurant in the hip and getting hipper Columbia City neighborhood...
THE ROSES: Food is quite good, with what appears to be a rapidly-rotating menu (no printed menus; current offerings are in a blackboard on the wall. Dishes are well executed, and service is quite good. Fun location with good view of the local scene. Upscale but friendly and unpretentious clientele makes for great people-watching.
THE THORNS: Even on a weeknight, parking is quite difficult in this neighborhood. Not as bad as Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, or Fremont, but no picnic. While having no printed menu and just relying on a chalkboard saves money, it's kind of a pain for those seated at far tables or with their backs to the board. Some dishes (fish soup) could be a little more aggressively seasoned. A little on the spendy side for what you're getting, especially the wines (nothing under $10/glass - they really need to offer a simple 'vin ordinaire' to compliment the rustic ambiance and menu).
THE VERDICT: This neighborhood institution's culinary offerings make it a real Seattle 'destination restaurant' as well. While a little spendy, it is a definite standout in Seattle's crowded Italian restaurant market. Recommend."

We are not the typical snobs to write negative reviews on a place just because the food was under salted. That being said, this was hands down the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. We made an anniversary reservation a week in advance, stoked to try this friken pasta. We arrived at 7:30, and our table was not ready. We waited an additional 15 minutes to be seated at a table (that wasn't so great to be honest) and ordered drinks. Drinks took about 20 minutes to come out. By then we were a little annoyed but still, we are pretty easy to please and understanding (industry gals), and they were busy for a Tuesday night.
All right y'all this is where it gets fun. Our server takes our FULL ORDER, complimenting us on what we've chosen. Tables around us get sat, we ask for a wine list.. Tables around us get food... We're still waiting on our wine list.
Finally, we get a list.. select a bottle. 15 mins go by we get our bottle... we're drinking a whiiiiiiiiile..
and then,
OUR SERVER ASKS IF WE ARE READY TO ORDER DINNER. I'm sorry, what? We've already been waiting over an hour for our apps. Said server asks us to repeat what we initially ordered. Chef comes out and apologizes.. it never got put in. They didn't put in the dang order. What the H-E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! At this point, we're about to break up with each other after six long years cause we're hangry. Our relationship has lasted so many ups and downs but not this got dang service y'all. So we leave, our drinks comped (duh) and will probably never come back. Go to McDonald's, you'll honestly get better service.

"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Matthew L.","Have been here twice. First time, last summer, was great. Happy hour menu restaurant and ambience was perfect.
Came back last night to celebrate a birthday and had just an odd, expeexperience. Restaurant was 4/5 empty. They sat us in the bar area which we wanted so we could do happy hour menu. What's too bad is they have this super aggressive outdoor lighting that shines like a flashlight on the tables in that area and is pretty much an ambience killer. So we asked if we could sit anywhere else. Server was frankly a little rude and then moved us over to another seat about 5 feet away. Then he took the happy hour menus away and said he couldn't serve those to us since we had left the bar area. Sorry but... why are you making this awful guest experience ... I suggested that felt a little silly and the answer I got back was ""I don't control this I'm just a server"".
Which of course sucks for everyone.
Food was delicious that's not the issue. They could not have been nicer to our daughter.
The issue seems to be with the owners who have apparently disempowered their teams from being customer centric. I felt a little bad for the servers. Which are all the wrong emotions to be having when you're out for a nice night!
Also music - not sure why but it was some top 40 crap. Seattle restaurants HAVE to please up their music game. I spend $200+ on dinner to be inspired.

"Le Messe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-messe-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Terri W.","Went to Le Messe last night; four of us ordered the Four-Course Tasting Menu. Here's the rundown of what we got:
App 1. Beets w/oil-cured olives and Marcona almonds in a vinaigrette: Very tasty.
App 2. Hamachi Crudo (Hamachi fish, served raw) with shaved kumquat, chilis, and celery: Good, but a bit too mild in flavor.
App 3. Fresh mozzarella slices topped with some kind of chunky orange-red sauce (not sure what it was): this was my least favorite dish -- pretty blah, under-salted, and the flavor and appearance of the orangey-red stuff on top of the cheese was utterly unidentifiable; the only thing I could identify were some mustard seeds. I didn't care for this dish much.
App 4. Delicata Squash with Rapini and black olive: the squash was delicious, but the rapini was pretty bitter, even for rapini.
App 5. Salad of leaf lettuce with candied pecans, freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic vinaigrette. Very tasty.
Pasta 1. Cacio e Pepe Pasta (rigatoni w/cheese and pepper) with actual/real white truffle (not ""truffle oil""): Very delicious! Given that (I believe) they make their pasta fresh every day, I expected a more delicately-textured pasta. It was a little on the thicker, sturdier side, which wasn't a bad thing - it's just that I wasn't expecting that. However, it was fully cooked, yet remained al dente. I actually liked the chewier texture. The sauce is made of Pecorino Romano and black pepper -- with the added bonus of white truffle -- and served with more grated cheese on top - yummy!!!
Pasta 2. Agnolotti (a stuffed pasta) that was filled with short rib, served with Delicta squash and either hazelnuts or Marcona almonds. Very delicious.
Protein 1. Sea Scallops, with parsnip-and-celery root puree, and fried parsnip chips, in Salmoriglio (a Southern Italian condiment made of lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, chopped oregano and parsley, salt, and pepper). Good, but not great in my opinion. The scallops seemed to be properly cooked, with a good sear on at least one side, but it seemed under-seasoned, and something in the dish tasted a little bitter.
Protein 2. Short Ribs. I loved them, but I'm very partial to short ribs, so I may not be very objective. Everyone seemed to like them, but maybe not as much as I did.
Dessert 1. Chocolate Brownie, with sea salt, whipped cream, almonds, and a raspberry sauce: Good; the sea salt made it better.
Dessert 2. Mascarpone Cake with roasted (or poached?) plums and whipped cream. Good.
It's a small restaurant, but when we got there (5:30) it was still fairly empty, so it wasn't noisy. However, a large group that arrived a little later was seated next to us, and they were very noisy. The décor is all hard surfaces, so it was very loud. This is a downside, in my opinion.
Also, we were there for a long time - over 3 hours. So, the hard bench seat we were sitting on was getting pretty hard by then, if you know what I mean. Fortunately, we didn't get any dirty looks or vibes indicating that we really needed to move along, and I appreciate that. (I was keeping an eye on the host station to see if people were waiting to be seated, and I never saw that happen, so I guess we lucked out.)
When we're in the mood for pasta, we'll put this place on our list of options, so we may well come back some time. But I'm not feeling that ""I've just GOT to come back again for sure!"" In other words, we all enjoyed our food (every dish went back to the kitchen completely empty) and we were satisfied with our experience, but it didn't send me over the moon."

Went there with seven other members of my family to celebrate 6 birthdays of our 8 person party, and the kitchen couldn't get our food out to us in less than 75, yes 7-5, minutes. No, it wasn't busy, in fact half empty at 615p on Saturday night - not a great sign anyway. During this eternity, we were told the entrees would be right out two separate times, while no manager came to ask what he could do, offer drinks or even complimentary bread. My 86 year old mother commented that it was even worse service than at her rest home. When they finally got some entrees out to us, 3 of the 8 took additional time. The pasta was warm, but not hot, but we were exhausted by that time and just dealt with it.
Server, Phil, was apologetic but the damage had been done. I picked the restaurant, and was embarrassed by the ""fiasco"". In the end, they comp'd 30% off the bill, but with so many choices in Seattle, it would take an extraordinary circumstance for is to return. Maybe the company that owns Fiasco and Pablo y Pablo is the issue, since you either have a culture of serving your customer, or you don't!

As soon as we arrived, we were told the kitchen was backed up despite the restaurant only being half full. The biggest offense though was the giant hair one of the clients found in their salad.
Once we notified the waiter, he didn't even apologize. He simply took it back to the kitchen and we had to wait another 15 minutes for a replacement to come out. And when it did finally come out, it was once again without any sort of apology. They still charged us for his meal too."

professional and friendly. The crispy duck leg was fantastic, but the portion very small. My requested classic cace e pepe pasta was overwhelmed by the peppercorns. While the pasta was cooked al dente, the over powering pepper almost made the dish in eatable. My wife began coughing after one taste and waved it off. I ate the pasta because I wanted her to enjoy the duck leg.
Surprisingly, I enjoyed How To Cook A Wolf more than my wife, who was appalled at the pasta; she being Italian. Hey, the kitchen hit 500, that's okay, and makes me want to try it again."

What I can't stress enough is that the service is absolutely AMAZING. It's probably the best service I've ever received in a restaurant ever. Period. Hands down. Our server could've recited the entire menu from memory, never needed to write our orders down, was able to suggest pairings of drinks, appetizers, and desserts, and had everything timed perfectly, so we could enjoy the pace of the meal. What an experience.
The inside space is small (definitely make a reservation if you can), but it has elegant, yet homey vibes, with cozy lighting and decoration to keep the atmosphere perfect for a date night, but appropriate for a business dinner. The drink menu is exquisite, with some of the most unique cocktail combinations ever. All that I tried were delicious.
The portions are small - the menu is clearly meant to sample and share, but if you're bold and looking to try what's available, this place is an absolute must. It's also in a great location, with surprisingly easy parking, and some of the most flavorful and delicious bites I had on my entire trip."

Food is under proportioned, overpriced, and tastes like very generic grocery store condiments are used. Our antipasto and pizza had a solid 30 minutes in between being served to us- takes way too long to be placed on our table.
The pizza was underflavored, undercooked yet overcooked in some parts, and very small? My party and I utilized the chili oil and chili flakes a little too much.
It also took our party several tries to get the server's attention to get the check. We were really polite the entire time and there was maybe one other party in the restaurant.
Out of everything the Saute di Vongole (Hama Hama mailla clams oven roasted in white wine) were probably the best."

That said, I've found their pizzas to be inconsistent. Sometimes too charred, occasionally with a bit of ash from the wood fire, and they tend to under-top the pizzas. For instance, the Chanterelle Bianco I ordered had about one mushroom per slice, and parts of the slices had no toppings whatsoever, not even a bit of olive oil base).

We ordered 2 arugula salads and a prosciutto crudo pizza between 2 of us, and a glass of the house red wine. The salad was okay, but it didn't come tossed. It only consisted of arugula, Parmesan, and lemon, with barely any olive oil. Although it was good, we expected that for the $8 we paid for each salad, they would have provided a bit more. We could have easily made the salad at home. I also wished there were entree-sized salad options for the purpose of sharing as an appetizer. In terms of the pizza, it came uncut and we had to cut the hot pizza ourselves with scissors. While it tasted good, we wish there was more cheese and was overall less soggy. The dough was good but the toppings ratio felt off. For what it was, we don't think the pizza was worth the $18.
Overall, the ambience was nice, but food was not worth the price."

"Osteria la Spiga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-spiga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Leah L.","Went here specifically because of a girl with celiac disease. This place has a ton of gluten free items in the menu and they market themselves as catering to people with gluten allergies. Loved that they have a large variety of gluten free pastas around 7pm. They then told her that they ran out of gluten free pasta. They said ""let me go see what options there are"". In the mean time, everyone else's food came out, there were 6 of us! The waitress walked by and we asked if they had any news and she said she forgot to ask and kept going to the back. One of our party got the last salmon fillet and she graciously gave her her dish. The celiac girl then asked the manager to make sure that the dish was actually gluten free. The manager went to the kitchen and disappeared for a while and came back to say that they were only 95% sure that the salmon was gluten free so it's up to you if you want to eat it. WhATT!!!??? This place advertises that they are a gluten free place! They recommended the salmon dish. Then they came back and said they ran out of salmon!!!! How does that happen!!??
By the time the manager came back to tell her that the dish was only 95% sure not gluten free, everyone was already halfway through their meals, and celiac girl was still sitting waiting. One in the party was very adamant about talking to the manager and when the manager finally came out, he wasn't very concerned about the situation. He offered to comp the pasta that the nice girl ordered as a replacement meal and offered to give the celiac girl a sorbet, which they knew was gluten free. But then the sorbet never came out! This wasn't the only gluten free restaurant on the street. The party could have chosen a multitude of other restaurants. It was a Monday night and they had an all night happy hour, which suggests that Monday's are slow nights. The manager really didn't seem believe the celiac girl, he seemed to think she was just choosing not to eat gluten. Absolutely terrible customer service
In terms of non-gluten free dishes, the pasta dishes were quite good and the tiramisu was delicious.
Unfortunately, the misalignment between marketing and reality was just too jarring for me to come back here."

We did a half mushroom half veggie pizza. It came out fairly quickly considering there was only one guy doing the pizzas. It's cool you can see him make them and use the fire oven and everything. It was like $18 which is a little steep for me considering we easily could have each gotten a pizza for ourselves but I understand.
They do have a house made oil that you can dip your pizza into and that's pretty good and original!"

"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Carla J.","I came in to Grazie with high expectations after hearing that their chefs train in Italy and good things from people I know. Because of this I suggested we try Grazie for dinner on Sunday night with out of town guests. Not all my expectations were met but overall a decent meal but with a little bit of a higher price tag than it deserved.
Service here was great. Everyone was super attentive, our water was refilled multiple times all without a prompt. Our appetizers and meals were quickly on our table so there's no issue with how they treat their guests.
The decor at Grazie felt a little off. For a place like this, I expected something a little more modern to go along with how they price their dishes but instead it felt like a chain Italian restaurant nearby. I also noticed a distinctly fishy smell in the air and I couldn't place where it was coming from, this above all was off-putting to me.
For appetizers we ordered caesar salad. The salads were well dressed and seasoned nicely but their dressing was super packed with garlic, to the point that our palettes were almost blown for the rest of the meal... and we love garlic. As for our entrees, nothing particularly remarkable about them. I had Pollo Al Limone, which was pretty much chicken piccata with artichokes. The odd thing about this dish is they serve it with their ""house pasta"" which is pasta with a tomato sauce. I've had a lot of chicken piccata (and dishes like it) and I have never seen someone pair that protein and sauce with something tomato based. It just seemed wrong to me. I wish they included more of a description of their house pasta on their menu because I would have asked for a substitution... or just plain pasta!
At the end of our meal, we got our checks and paid our bills. The server accidentally charged the wrong cards for the wrong bill. One of the amounts charge didn't even match a bill so we were not sure where that came from. We understood mistakes happen so we had no problem with him fixing the issue but he had to hunt down his manager to resolve the problem. I was uncomfortable with our credit cards being out for possession for as long as they were. The manager should have come to us and apologized but we never saw them.
Unless there's a happy hour special, I don't think I will be back. There was nothing remarkable that I tasted that I would crave to go back for. Their pricing is definitely higher than I think it should be, portion size is average. For example, $27 for their Pollo Limone is just too much."

At the end of your meal, they show you the dessert display and every last item looked delicious. If I wasn't so full, I would have taken a slice of Tiramisu. In addition to everything, the customer service was excellent.
Will definitely be back soon to try more items."

"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Marjorie H.","I wanted to like this place, I really did. But our experience went downhill once the server brought us our water.
First, the Chianti was mediocre at best. It had very little flavor, and the longer it sat and warmed, the harder I found it was to drink. It began to have an aftertaste that was unpleasant.
Next came the bread. Most Italian places we have been to serve warm, fresh bread. This was neither warm nor fresh. It wasn't even cut the whole way through, and we were not given a knife to finish the cuts. The bread was tough, and dry. The oil dipping mix was good, but it was lacking fresh ground pepper.
Our food was mediocre at best. I got Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the meatballs were uneatable, my husband got the Piatti (seafood and ravioli) - his seafood was over cooked and rubbery and his ravioli was under cooked. Plus the shrimp in his dish still had the tails on. Since the dish had pasta, the tails really should have had the removed. It makes for a very messy situation otherwise. The third member of our party got the Fettuccine Alfredo Chicken. The chicken came out mostly fatty pieces, and the fettuccine sauce had no flavor. Worst of all was the kids chicken meals. Pre-frozen Dinosaurs Chicken nuggets. Now, I understand how this might seem easier for the restaurant. But kids deserve to have food that comes without any additives. Every other Italian restaurant that we visit frequently offers freshly breaded chicken tenders.
Needless to say, when the server finally came back to offer dessert, we all passed and drove over to Panera Bread instead. We never got drinks refilled, and had to share our water with the kids in order to refill their drinks."
"Grazie Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-tukwila?osq=Italian+Food","Scott L.","Chicken Alfredo was marginal. Sauce wasn't thick enough; flavor was not great. Puttanesca was good. Service was very good. Atmosphere was fine. Prices were too expensive for the quality of the food. Overall, I'd give it a 5/10. Not headed back soon."

Obviously it's a nice restaurant, so that's expected. The only reason I'm even writing this review is because when we ordered, the waitress asked if we wanted a salad WITH our food. She asked as if it was a side salad and considering that we were paying $20 for a small plate of mediocre pasta I assumed it would be included. Come to pay the bill and we were charged an extra $15 JUST FOR SALAD! Salad prices were no where on the menu either. We racked up a $70 bill for 2 small plates of pasta and 2 salads. Might as well go to Olive Garden"

"Palermo-Ballard","https://www.yelp.com/biz/palermo-ballard-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","James T.","Had dinner for the first time here tonight and it was great. Our server greeted us and took our drink orders promptly, and our food arrived much faster than we had anticipated. The pizza was fantastic, I got the Palermo special and it was the perfect combination of topping flavors, rich cheese and perfectly cooked crust. The menu variety was a little shocking for such a small place, I was pleasantly surprised by how many options I could pick from. I will have to come back to try some of the specials that our server suggested, they all sounded delicious but tonight we were in the mood for pizza.
The only downside to our visit was something a few members of our party witnessed. We noticed a young woman eating in the back of house in full view of the restaurant. I'm not sure what her role was, for the most part she was simply standing around talking with other employees and eating from what I saw, but regardless it was pretty off-putting to see what appeared to be an employee eating in the back of house where guests could see her. It made me wonder what the standards for that sort of thing in Palermo's back of house were. Having worked in restaurants for a while I'm assuming that this was a one time mistake that doesn't happen frequently, as I know there are usually strict rules about not eating where guests can see you. I hope that the employee is talked to about the behavior!
Other than that one negative experience, I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the food."

I have visited Palermo several times and each time is fine, but no aspect is excellent. The food is hit or miss; I have had several dishes that were pretty good and well seasoned, but also several bland dishes. My friend has warned me against the pizza, so I have yet to try it.
The service is not great, not bad. I have had one very inattentive sever and several nice servers, but none of them seem particularly happy to serve you. They do have $3 a glass wine on Tuesdays and Thursdays (I believe those are the correct days) which is a plus."

The pesto chicken sandwich had hardly any pesto, the chicken was dry and over cooked. The spaghetti bolognese was a joke! NO flavor what so ever! The side salad that comes with the pasta is completely bare! Couple strips of lettuce a slice of tomato and slice of Cucumber. Ranch super watered down. Sandwhich and pasta was tossed out!

I was pleased to see there was a nice lunch menu. We ordered the mini pizza which is I believe $8.50 and you can choose two toppings. We chose mushrooms and pepperoni (YUM!) It also comes with the soup of the day or salad. We also got the chicken fetuccine alfredo ($10.50) which also comes with your choice of the soup or salad. Since we were sharing, we ordered both a soup and a salad.
The soup of the day was chicken noodle. I was actually really impressed with the soup. I loved how thick the noddle was and the flavor of the broth was really good. The noodle was the perfect texture! The pizza was way smaller than we thought it would be, it was really yummy though. The fetuccine alfredo tasted pretty mediocre, no complaints. The two breadsticks it came with was really good.. nice crunch and yummy garlic flavor.
They have happy hour which is nice, I might come again during those times. They also serve breakfast all day! The food was good but I wasn't blown away."

We had been planning on eating pizza that night for a while, but were stumped as to where we should go. At first, this place seemed an unlikely contender, as the options seemed really limited and we were unsure of how good the pizza would be. However, after much deliberating, we decided to go with Italian Family Pizza and we did not regret it!
We ordered a medium cheese pizza with bell pepper, mushroom, and garlic topping over the phone, and it was ready to pick up in 20 minutes. Soon as we walked in, they had our pizza out and ready, freshly made. The pizza tasted great -- the garlic steeped into the cheese well and the veggies used were freshly baked into the pizza. The crust was also surprisingly good, too. It was both amazing and filling for two hungry girls wanting to stay at home and watch movies!

If you're craving a gooey, spicy, crusty pizza, get the New Yorker. Genuine sausage, perfectly spicy cherry peppers, topped with gooey, creamy Ricotta, thin chewy toasty crust.
The gravelly-voiced server reminded me of a Doonesbury character, and the tableware was completely bright red plastic on an imitation-concrete table. Red cup, red plate, red napkin. I'm not kidding. As if that wasn't bizarre enough, to add to the ambience a sci-fi thriller movie was on in the background, replete with gutteral primordial noises.
But, there's no denying that pizza was incredibly good."

The not-so-good:
The changed design. This space used to have the most beautiful designed interior and sensible flow. Now, long tables are inches away from the cozy half-moon booths-- poor design. My companion and I could barely hear each other.
The food was mixed.
We had to request bread-- why??
When it arrived it plain-- sans butter or olive oil.
The apps were good-- the polenta fritters quite tasty.
As were the oysters.
I order the burger & fries. The fries arrived cold.
The bun was mushy-- totally disintegrated into the burger--messy.
Why not a Macrina-- or similar-- roll??
The obligatory 20% service fee-- which is not listed on the menu.

I did have a weird experience with the waiter though. He sat all three of the groups in the restaurant in a corner by the window. After he gave each of the groups water, he got all of us to quiet down and started presenting the specials to all of us at the same time. They had just a ton of specials though so I could see why he didn't want to repeat himself.
Other than the specials announcement, it started to get a little warm with the sun coming in through the West facing window. If you're here in the summer, maybe ask for a seat away from the window.

It is there to absorb the incredible amount of sauce and good olive oil in your dish; the focus is not on the flavor of the bread itself. No, it's not modern artisanal bread. It's not trying to be, and it doesn't need to be. Don't dig it? Fine. But don't claim you want authentic and then bash it when it actually arrives!"

And they already know me! I take comfort In seeing the same faces that have been there for a length time. ( staff ) and I've yet to be dissatisfied with the service provided.
I can say without a doubt this is one of my top five in Seattle from the gut of the market. From Seattle over all! If you are a tourist, do not rob yourself of good meal and strong drink at a more than fare price.

While service and ambiance at il bistro are always wonderful, the food has gone dramatically downhill in the last year or so. On our most recent visit, the pizza came out cold, the pasta was undercooked and the Caesar salad tasted oddly like pickles. Very strange. The visit prior featured burnt pizza and unsalted prawns... it's a smorgasbord of culinary disasters.
Despite that we will probably be back because they're open late, staff is helpful, the bartenders are friendly and the prices are low. If the food was consistent it would be a more regular spot... fingers crossed it picks back up. We will keep the faith until then!"

Their food is full of flavours, and are very uniquely designed - definitely some authentic Italian pastas and entrées. I tried the lobster ravioli with shrimp. The sauce was great! One of the best I have ever tasted. However the lobster ravioli was not very fresh and as someone who is sensitive to the fresh taste of seafood I can tell that it has been keep for a while. The portion was decent, but may not be enough for big appetite. My friends ordered the lamb shank, which was well cooked, soft and soaked in flavoues. The shank has lots of meat. We also ordered their seafood fried rice, which is equally awesome. Their seafood pasta is good, though not spenlendid.
We can see their cheif cooking. It seems there is just one/two people preparing and cooking the food so it takes a while to get our food. They gave free bread as appetizers. We also ordered their tiramisu which I am not a fan of. Overall a solid restaurant."

Now the food. I had the burger and it did not disappoint. From the quality of the patty and freshness of the baby greens, to their HOUSE-MADE salad dressings (strawberry vinaigrette holy t*ts), this is not a place to sleep on. As far as we know, they're less than a month old and are in the process of getting their liquor license so can't image how even greater of an atmosphere they'll create as they grow.

Don't people want somewhere nice to have a drink and a snack before the ballet, or the opera, or other evening events? It's a mystery for the ages, but I'm pleased to say that Solo Bar has become a dependable, if quirky, happy hour spot in Lower Queen Anne.
I'll be the first to admit that the space feels a little strange when you walk in. The tables are oddly far apart, there's a low stage with a couch and coffee tables that juts into the room, and some more awkwardly low couch seating in a corner. It definitely feels like a wall was knocked down to join two separate spaces, and some odd partitions and internal walls remain, which break up the room strangely. If the weirdness is too much, just sit at the bar, which faces away from the room and its distracting use of space! Most of the tables are small four-tops, so it's easy for staff to push a bunch together for a large group (as we were the first time I was there).
Happy hour goes until 6 pm and has some solid deals: $4.50 wells, specialty cocktails $4-6, and a small selection of wine by the glass, $5-6. There are a few discounted happy hour snacks, too, but I encourage you to check out the regular dinner menu, which is pretty affordable ($8-16) and offers a nice variety of comfort food classics. The lamb meatballs are a shareable appetizer or a good-sized entree for one. My dining companion really liked the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But the Waldorf quinoa bowl is filling and tasty, and doesn't feel like a sad diet-food sacrifice! There are also some soup and salad, mushroom pate, and veggie pasta options for vegetarians, and gluten-free options.
The specialty cocktails are surprisingly affordable even at regular prices (most are $6-8), so it's no biggie if you miss last call for happy hour. I like the Paper Plane and pear collins, and they have several Moscow mule variations that look intriguing. There's also a short list of nonalcoholic drinks, including cold brew and a virgin pear collins, for you designated drivers.
Service is friendly and welcoming, although it can get scattered during peak times, so you might have to tag your server if you need to get your bill in time for a show. The atmosphere feels casual and relaxed, not pretentious or hipstery at all, and it's often surprisingly chill during happy hour, so don't worry about popping in by yourself for a quiet drink. Solo is quickly becoming my Seattle Center-adjacent go-to bar!"

For happy hours, everything is 50% off so I got like 2 bar appetizers and a drink for $15.
The food are all delicious and their drinks are also pretty on point. Their Bloody Mary is awesome. But watch out Ms. Rachel the bartender because she has a heavy hand haha. She tends to give you quite some alcohol in one drink.
A little hip and quirky vibe. Attract a lot of musicians to come here hang out. Overall it is a really cool place!"

I had the butternut squash pasta, and the cocktails are exceptionally original and tasty.
I'm leaving three starts because the actual service experience was very difficult. I had to perform a block away at eight, and needed to get there by 7:45. I ordered my food at 6:25, and it didn't get to my table till 7:10 (just one bowl of pasta) I asked for my check when the food was brought, because I knew I had to HURRY and things were very hectic in there, and the check was wrong, and because it was at this point impossible to flag down the waitress, I had to go to the bar and stand in a very long line ( like 10 people long) and wait quite a while to have the check fixed, and to pay and leave.
This was all because the place was PACKED for a show, and they only had one waitress on staff, to serve the entire restaurant AND bar.
She was absolutely doing her best, getting everything done as quickly as possible and remained friendly, even in the face of a bad situation. But this was my first time going there, and though I loved the food and drinks, the hectic and tense experience makes me hesitant to go back, but I will maybe give it one more chance, because the chef, at least, is doing something VERY right. Still, the owner needs to adequately staff this establishment."

It has a funky atmosphere.
Nice happy hour menu; it has something for those who are watching their diet and those who are not. Truffle popcorn is fabulous. The mixed nuts have a Sweet covering. The dates were warm and stuffed with goat cheese. Wonderful hummus.
The salads are nicely done without too much dressing. Try the lamb meatballs and salivate. The burger was cooked medium well, but was not over done.
The cocktail menu is small, but good. I like the wine and beer menu. The prices are very fair. The service has been wonderful.
Great spot; great time. Come visit."

BUT IT DOES!!
It's one of the few places left in the city where you can get a cocktail you know someone thought about and put love in to creating without breaking the bank. Most cocktails are around $8 (cheaper during happy hour) and for how delicious the food is it's very moderately priced. Their menu changes with the seasons so I can't say I've tried everything, but I've tried a lot of things on the menu and I've yet to taste anything I dislike. Some of the dishes are very light and health conscious and some are rich and filling, but it's all yummy.
During the day they keep the place pretty lightly staffed so if you're looking for speedy service I'd suggest walking up to the bar.
One thing to be weary about is there's A LOT of events that go on the the area (the ballet, concerts, theater, etc.) so if you happen to go on a night that coincides with one of these events just make sure you plan for a wait on food, it's a small kitchen and they're doing their best but it's hard to keep up when the whole city shows up at one time."

After a friend's recommendation, we stopped in at about 6:00PM after a SIFF film. No tables were occupied. A young guy was cleaning up two tables. We asked him if there was a food menu and he plopped a couple on a table and walked off. He was mixing drinks at a fairly quiet bar and NEVER returned to our table for drink or food orders. We left after about 10-15 minutes and I'm sorry we waited so long to leave. The menu looked good and we had decided to have some dinner and beer and sangria. I don't know why we were so rudely treated but suspect that we did not meet their customer age criteria (We're 68 and 72). It was absolutely not busy; we were the only guests seated at a table and since the guy gave us menus, it was definitely dinner time. Will never try that place again."

I've been out of the foodie scene in Seattle for awhile and hadn't heard of it, and when the name came up in a yelp search I groaned. ""Oh lord, another twee hipster place with inconsistent food and overly pedantic service!"" is what I thought.
But I read the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a go, even though we had no reServations. The place wasn't full but it was busy, and when I said i had a party of two but no rezzies they pointed me to the bar, which frankly is where I would rather eat anyways. (Pro tip: you can nearly always sneak a seat for dinner at the bar in a good popular restaurant. It's the only way I will eat at the Met.)
So, I sit down and the bartender asks if I want sparkling or still water. Well dammit that's a nice touch. Then the beer I want is out, but they load a new keg for, quickly and without rancor. Also nice.
Then the food! We had the charcuterie, oysters, octopus, steak and split a panna cotta for dessert. I usually look for one standout, one solid and then give the place credit if the worst dish is something I could probably do better at home.
Every dish was very, very good. Very good. Service was thorough and attentive without being cloying. And for Seattle the bill wasn't horrifying!
The only thing I can complain about is the vibe, and it's a minor complaint. The decorations and design are ""neutral"" in the best and worst senses of the word: they don't get in the way of really great food (yay!) But they are boring (boo!).
I will absolutely come here again!"

Service was Ok, had to ask for bread a few times, however initially was not even offered bread/butter. Seems like it arrives upon 2nd request.
Food was good, but portions for the price are stingy. Plate with beef cheeks came out with one side of the plate super hot, another side luke warm. Indicator that the food was not made to order, but heated to order. Amatuer move.
The kicker- even for 3 people 20% mandatory tip is already included.
Why 20%? Why not 18 or 21? Tip is supposed to be something that is valuated arbitrarily based on individual experience. An incentive, if you will, for wait staff to be on point.
The bill conveniently had a line for Tip, that is in addition to already mandated 20% and the wait staff sheepishly never mentioned that aspect. In other words, they will gladly take your money if you are not looking at the check details. Pretty shady business practice if you ask me. Will not be coming back.
To the management - if you have specific to say, I would like to hear. You token ""Our apologies, regret, your dining experience, tips are going to xyz"" and the rest of corporate phrases - please save them.
It was a Friday evening 7:00 PM, place was pretty empty, left around 9:00 PM, it was still emptier than ever......"

The bartenders are the best. They have great listed cocktails and I've had them invent a new cocktail on the fly. If the place isn't super busy, they will interact with you making you feel really comfortable.
The bar is built around the cocktails and the bartenders. The decor is okay for my tastes.
The place can be too small at times so great for a romantic stop but a large party might have to wait for a large table.
If you want more than bar snacks, skip this place but come back after you had food for a great time."

Belltown has some amazing cocktail lounges already, so Roquette is up against some stiff competition. I might be back for a date in the future, but with Rob Roy, Mr. Darcy's and Branchwater a stone's throw away... maybe not.
The drink I got (think it was called Madame Derrier? Something bitter with whiskey) was indeed amazing, but spendy, even for Seattle. Date's drink was also good. Both were nice 'n' strong. But again, there are tons of great options around.
The inside of the bar is very dark, but somehow missing that coziness I expected. Maybe it was just because it was a sparse night...
The service wasn't great. We sat at a table near the window, away from the bar, and the server kept coming over to us (just have been half a dozen times, maybe more) to ask how we were. Each time, we were fine. I got the impression they wanted us to leave or order another drink or food, and we just didn't need it."

Prices: expensive
Service: shitty, hostile
Bar was empty when we came in. A number of us were meeting up at the bar. Table ran out of chairs so we pulled some of the bar stools for our friends (remember empty bar).
Lady told us we couldn't use the stools because it would block the ""aisle"" and would be a fire hazard. Fine, returned stools.
Friends stood around the table and lady came back and said we couldn't stand around the area because it would still block the aisle and still be a fire hazard. There was a corner area that opened up and she suggested we sit there.
Corner area was large, was not next to any aisle, but still did not have enough seats (poor floor management, there's 8 of us), and bar still empty. We pulled some stools cuz we figured no fire hazard. Lady said she we couldn't use the stools and wanted her stools back.
Friend mumbled a complaint and lady goes on a power trip, flexes that she has the ability to kick us out. We weren't loud, rude, or belligerent to any degree. We barely finished our first round of drinks. Whatever... we decided we didn't want to stay. Slammed our drinks and scrambled to get out of there.
Don't worry lady, I won't come back. I will take my yellow ass and green backs somewhere less hostile.
Btw, bar was still empty when we left."

French-Polynesian influence without going the way of a tiki-bar, the drinks are inventive and balanced. The menu will grow with time -- I believe it's been open less than a week -- but I was able to try their 47 Monkey Vesper, the white Negroni, and a TBD spirit-forward Mezcal cocktail (a creation of barman/designer Kyton). Each featured layered flavors that are perfect for the Summer.
Design-wise, the place is intimate but well lit, and the walnut accents and eclectic wallpapers throughout make for a fun backdrop.
Don't miss out on the hot chicharrones. And I think I heard something about about Bugles and caviar..."

We don't drink, but they had a spot available for dinner at the chefs counter. Coolest experience ever! The chefs are extremely talented, great conversation, and have a huge passion for what they do. I ordered the burger, and my boyfriend ordered the chorizo tacos. The burger was cooked absolutely perfect, fresh fries that stayed hot the entire meal! The chorizo tacos were the best blend of flavors I have ever experienced. I could not recommend this place enough! We cannot wait to go back."

The bar is well stocked and carefully curated by the owners, a couple that has been in the industry a long time and decided to open their own spot. It has a 20's prohibition vibe to it and there's even a semi-hidden back room with couches. Everyone that works there is SO friendly, the service was way above and beyond my expectations.

I called ahead to ensure they could accommodate vegans and they assured me they had a few great options. We get there for dinner w/a group and my husband and I decided upon a ""loaded"" veggie pizza without cheese to make it easy. Our pizza came out. It consisted of VERY little mushroom and onions (like, extremely scarce) and was completely covered entirely with dry arugula. Really? The pizza was paper thin. It was the most disappointing veggie pizza I've EVER seen a restaurant put together. To top that, we got the bill and saw they charged $18 for it!! No joke, we had multiple slices that had nothing on it but tomato sauce..‍
‍
Morale of the story. Vegan community: I DO NOT recommend this place.
**Update in response to owner message**
As a customer, I have every right to give my personal opinion on any and every establishment. I did just that, and had the owner tell me that I'm standing on a soap box yelling to the public and he's tired of unhappy customers ""running to their mother"". Really?! May I suggest learning more about customer acquisition and retention? To be quite frank, I shouldn't have to complain when I get my food. I made it very clear that we were vegan before arriving AND at the restaurant when conversing with server. Your establishment took it upon yourself to make us a ""vegan"" pizza that had two vegetables on it. Way to go over and beyond the first time around. I guess it's my fault tho since I didn't complain, right? It's ridiculous that you can't let someone give their honest opinion without passively aggressively insulting them.
Also, to set the record straight, when we spoke on the phone, I never said I was getting the sandwich, I was just asking about the options we had. I do appreciate you going out of your way (if you really did) to PCC, But honestly, that's part of being a business owner. You do what it takes to create an environment where guest satisfaction is your highest priority. If someone isn't happy, you don't attack them..
I'm so appalled at your response to my review."

I went here for a date and it was definitely the right ambiance for it. The area is cozy, the staff is friendly, and the lighting is dim. I ordered some wine, pizza, scallops, and a goat cheese salad. Keep in mind the scallops are more of a cheese dish that is melted with scallops. I thought it was going to be more of pieces of scallops with some cheese on them. The food as a whole was pretty good, I'd give it a 4/5... nothing that was a must have again.
Reservations were pretty quick and easy since you can do it online.
Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to go for a date night or night out with friends! The food is decent and the ambiance is great and chill."

My friend had a pizza and it came out with a bottle of chili oil (genius) to drizzle. I had the Caesar salad and it was great. The large was a perfect entree size and I could have added protein if I'd been more hungry, including salmon or shrimp for those of us avoiding meat/poultry. The waitstaff was friendly and professional. The atmosphere was nice though we were there on a slow night, I think it would feel a bit cramped if full. The music (like most restaurants these days) was too loud but our waitress was happy to turn it down a bit when we asked. The only let down was the wine list. By-the-glass selections were limited, it was all overpriced, and the pours were stingy. I had the most expensive red (we were celebrating) and the waitress said it was by far the best of the options (there were only three) at $15 a glass. It was meh. The others were $10.
Overall would definitely go again to eat, but would get a beer :)"

We went for dinner on a Saturday and were super impressed with our server. She explained the menu but didn't over do it and we felt zero pressure. We ended up each getting a glass of wine and splitting a Caesar salad and the pepperoni pizza. Both SO good. The pizza was a thinner crust too so we didn't feel stuffed which was a bonus. We'll definitely be going back!"

Great location for a group celebration or a fun date night. The pIZZA WAS PHENOMENAL bUt not the best thing on the menu in my book. The Chicken and Carne Asada entrees were delicious. The humus is a must as an appetizer which outshined the bruschetta. The Mint gin Julep tops their lists of creative libations. Make a reservation if you want to spend your time wisely."

The service was excellent and prompt. We had the pear and gorgonzola pizza ( such a delicious pairing) one of the most exquisite combinations I could not have fathomed.
For dessert we had the bread pudding against my usual chocolate cravings. The waitress put a candle for my birthday. A little too sweet for my taste but my husband polished it off !."

Service was friendly. Menu is small which I like.

From the reviews, I was expecting the food to be phenomenal, but it came up a little short. Ordered the fonduta cheese, gnocchi, and fig/prosciutto pizza. Everything was fine, but nothing stood out. To be honest, I've had better pizza at MOD pizza for less than half the price, but I guess you pay for the atmosphere of dining at a cute neighborhood restaurant. The drinks were fine and the service was satisfactory. I parked on the street a block away, at least parking was more plentiful than if the restaurant was located downtown. Overall, I wasn't blown away by anything, I would give this place a 3.5, but rounded up to a 4 to be nice."

( owner, if you're listening, putting in some ceiling noise dampeners would be sooo appreciated )
I've walked by and stared into the windows here many a times wishing to check it out. I had high expectations based solely on the cuteness factor. Finally got a chance to go and expectations were met and then some. We shared two starters, a serving of bread and one main entree. Not to mention a fancy ass bottle of Delille D2 DELICIOUS wine.
We had the cauliflower and the beef carpaccio starters. The beef carpaccio was beautiful to look at and beyond tasty. Like beyond. I could have easily had 5 more plates of it. It's not huge but it's a flavor bomb. The cauliflower was seasoned and prepared perfectly, and I don't really even like cauliflower. The rustic bread was happily smothered by me with the truffle butter that came along with it. Our finale was the spaghetti. Best spagetti, ever. Perfect homemade noodles, amount of sauce, meat chunks and adorned with the best mound of freshly grated parmesan cheese and herbs. Heaven.
When I go back, I need to try the bolognese next.

We chose to explore some items that weren't on the RW menu and had a great experience. The place was still bustling at 8 PM (we had a reservation). Staff are super friendly and all-around great.
We were seated at what is essentially the chef's counter and had front-row seats watching the chef/owner cook. I was super impressed watching him cook for the whole restaurant in this tiny kitchen on a four-burner electric stove and being able to see the process made the food taste even better.
Food was delicious. We started with the clams, which were in a piping-hot, very mildly spicy tomato-based sauce. The picci amatriciana was, to quote my BF, the best tomato-based pasta he's had in the past couple of years. Seared scallops were also very good. Overall a great experience.

Too bad, this dish used to be good, but it was so hot I couldn't even taste it. Really disappointed. Won't be back. Consistency matters, as do accurate descriptions. There's no need for arancini or papardelle bolognese to have that level of kick, definitely not what is expected or wanted."

Food: pasta is fresh and to die for. Incredibly rich and flavorful with generous portion sizing. We started with an appetizer of oysters which were perfectly fine, but priced a bit higher than market value.
Cocktails: spirit forward and expertly made. Honestly there nothing more to say
Atmosphere: The staff was delightful. There's a small indoor are and even smaller patio seating. Interestingly, they reported being booked up on the phone but the restaurant didn't fill the entire evening. Fortunately, the patio is first come first serve so we were seated quickly when we arrived."

Mizuna Salad (4/5): Great start to the meal, loved the crushed almonds/cheese on this salad
Calamari (4/5): Super refreshing! Not what you expect - the calamari is not deep fried and there's no breading (which makes it look naked) but it went great with celery and cauliflower. Healthy calamari option :)
Asparagus on savory panna cotta (5/5): I had never heard of a savory panna cotta before but that stuff comes from the Italian heavens. It's this amazing garlicky sauce that would make any vegetable your favorite.
Tagliatelle with ricotta and peas (5/5): Perfect pasta texture! The ricotta made the pasta interestingly sour but it really balanced out the cheesiness of this dish. Loved this creative pasta!
Risotto, mascarpone, mint (4/5): Would have preferred it if it weren't made with mixed grains (brown rice), but this felt like a healthy option!
Duck confit (5/5): ......THIS DUCK is why I will be returning to Vendemmia. Perfectly crisp skin on a melt-in-your-mouth duck leg, the best finely-mashed potatoes on the side, and the green
/ orange drizzle sauces made this dish top notch. I'd be hard pressed to find a more delicious duck.
Halibut (4/5): Nice crispy skin on this halibut too, but does not compare to the duck :)
Rhubarb panna cotta (5/5): If you like panna cotta, you will LOVE this jiggly wiggly panna cotta topped with oats.
Ricotta cake (5/5): My favorite dessert of the night - it looks like a cheese cake but it's not nearly as creamy/fatty/sweet. The cake itself is not sweet, but the raisins and almonds on the side made this dish so surprisingly great!
Tiramisu (5/5): It comes to your table as a deconstructed tiramisu cake, with pieces all over the place, which is pretty cool. Definitely one of the healthier tiramisu's I've had (seems to be a common thread among all their dishes) and I love that!
I'll be back, Vendemmia! And please have the duck confit on your rotating menu when I'm there!!"

We were sat at a table and served wine before we could really get a word out and we weren't even ID'ed which I thought was strange. We had our IDs out and the owner gave us a weird look like we didnt need to show them to him.
The food kept coming and there were no menus. The meals are apparently ""customized"" but the dishes were what everyone else was getting as well. The food itself was terrible. We were getting nauseas after the 3rd course. I couldnt even identify some of the food. We finally asked one of the servers to box our next course because we wanted to just pay and leave. The owner also asked us if we wanted a refill of our wine and we said no. Five minutes later he pours us a second glass. We recieved dessert which was pretty basic but not nauseating.
Then the bill comes, it totaled about $110 for two people. Keep in mind there were no questions about what our budget was and no insight to how much these ""customized"" dishes cost. We were also charged for a full bottle of wine which we definitely did not consume. We were also charged an extra 10 dollars for desert...which we thought would be included in a 4-7 course meal. The owner came by and apologized for charging us for a full bottle of wine...and then told us to basically not TIP to make up for it.
So instead of just quickly refunding us and printing out a new ticket, he decided to screw over his servers who were definately pooling tip!
This place and its owner is a joke."

"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Itzel S.","My husband suggested we try this restaurant after viewing the menu on Open Table and Yelp. When we got there and asked to see the menu, the waitress said ""we don't do that, you need to trust us."" After probing she provided a brief vague description of the process- Basically it's a Chef's Selection 5 course meal - then asked if we had any dietary restrictions. After expressing some concerns with the whole just trust us thing, she promised she would accommodate all of my restrictions.
We pressed on and decided to keep an open mind. We had to wait 15-20 minutes between courses. The food was average at best - oddly reminiscent of something you'd get from Chef Boyardee. Not to mention they serve it to you with ZERO description of what was just placed in front of you. I guess this is what they meant by ""just trust us.""
If that wasn't bad enough, over an hour in, while waiting for the third course, the chef/owner approaches us and asks that we could please get up and move because he'd forgotten about a large party that needed our table.
I personally feel that listing an itemized menu on places like Yelp and Open Table, when what they really offer is only a Chef's Selection menu, is misleading and confusing. Especially as a diabetic patron who needs to know what I'm about to consume in order to administer the right amount of insulin. (PSA: If you have any kind of dietary restrictions, please avoid this place at all costs)
Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment. The service was poor, the mystery ""meh"" portions were small and the entire experience was frustrating and confusing. If you're looking for subpar Italian food and mediocre service go to The Olive Garden - at least there, you know what you're signing up for."

This place is nothing short of darling and you are practically guaranteed to have a great experience. The main thing you need to know: no menus. You read that right, there are no menus. Mike, the owner and chef and sweetheart of a human being will come to your table and see what you don't eat. One person doesn't want shellfish? No problem. One person is a vegetarian? No worries. One person doesn't like any kind of seafood or spicy or long pasta or mushrooms? No worries. Mike has you covered. Once that convo has happened, all you need to do at that point is sit back and relax and wait for plate after plate of food to be delivered to you. There will be an appetizer. There will be a salad. And there will be other foods that will blow your mind. And without exaggeration, in the hundred or so times I have eaten here I've never had the same meal twice.
And do not forget to leave room for dessert! Flan, tiramisu, cheesecake, ice cream, cannoli - True to form you never know what you are going to get but it's going to be amazing.
Evening parking directly across the street is plentiful and free. But you might want to walk for a few miles to burn off all of the food you just ate :-)"
"Pasta Freska","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-freska-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeremy S.","I've been going to Pasta Freska since 10 years ago and it hasn't really changed much. The decor is very similar if not the same and food tastes like homemade Italian food.
Pasta Freska is a great place to go to when you don't want to think about a menu instead of wanting to go somewhere you can socialize with some friends or a date. I wont describe too much of the experience because many Yelp reviewers already have.
I just have a few notes to make: one time I made reservations via their website. When I was there with a date, a server came up to us and I told them we had reservations. He responded with ""Really, are you sure?"" as if he couldn't find us. It was weird because I even had text proof that it was booked. He then said ""hold on one second"" and left. It wasn't until someone else came (I think the owner) that he asked how many we had again and sat us. It was kind of a weird situation.
Then last night, I went there with 3 of my friends who booked via Open Table and we got there at 6:30pm. There was at least 15 people in the front waiting and the host said they were running late and backed up. He didn't check or write anything down. So we got the feeling that we wouldn't be able to get our seats and after waiting a while, we left. The funny thing is, I used Open Table to find some other time tables elsewhere and Pasta Freska was listed with an open table at 7 pm, 7:15 pm. 7:30 pm, etc. which was clearly not going to happen... So I would suggest that you don't trust the reservations here and be prepared to wait. Otherwise come right when they open or on weekdays."

You will need reservations. Because of this, you will notice most of the dining room will be seated within a short timeframe.

"Montalcino Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/montalcino-ristorante-italiano-issaquah?osq=Italian+Food","Andrea P.","Montalcino is NOT the Montalcino that we loved before it was sold recently. We invited a couple of clients after raving about our 'favorite' Italian restaurant on the Eastside and told the waitress this was a client dinner. She immediately promoted their Barbera wine special without telling us the price and bringing out a taste and saying, ""You absolutely must try this wine!"". And because we didn't wish to look cheap we did not ask for the price and ordered a bottle, and ultimately two more glasses in which they gave one pour in one glass and only a half a pour in the 2nd because it still had 1/2 glass remaining. When the bill arrived we were charged over $60 for the bottle on 'special' and $34 for the 1 1/2 pours!
Then we ordered some of Mama's homemade cheese for an appetizer, something we always ordered in the past because we had been introduced to the previous owner's mother while she was actually making the cheese. The previous owners are neighbors of our very good friends. This is when we not only were told the restaurant had been sold, but that supposedly Momma never made the cheese! So we knew this was a bold faced lie! The cheese plate arrived and there were only 4 minute slices of cheese, barely a bite per person, when in the past it was plenty for four people!
The food was decent, but not the excellent fare we had come to expect from Montalcino, and that went for us and our non-Italian clients. Understand my family is Italian, eat fantastic Italian food at home nearly 3 days per week, we just returned from several weeks in Italy taking cooking classes in various regions, and have sampled nearly every Italian restaurant in Seattle and the Eastside.
And when we were ready to order desert we were told that we only had 10 minutes left of our allotted time on our reservation. Another first as we often had spent more time eating dinner there. It felt somewhat like eating at cafeteria.
Then the bill arrived. Including wine, appetizers, and main courses, no dessert of course, for four people, $498.95. Plus tip this felt like a lot for what we received, and were used to receiving in the past.
Big disappointment!"
"Montalcino Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/montalcino-ristorante-italiano-issaquah?osq=Italian+Food","Riz Q.","Had a reservation for 8:30 but the party who's table we would be taking ended up staying longer than anticipated. The 4 of us were perfectly content standing in the hostess area listening to the sweet man playing guitar and singing. Fernando (who is the owner) personally greets everyone and he was extremely apologetic that we weren't being seated right away since we had a reservation and brought us all a glass of Prosecco which was completely unexpected and appreciated.
After being seated, we were immediately greeted and asked how our night was going. Immediately felt welcome to be sitting in her section and never felt differently. We chatted a bit and decided on the meat and cheese platter to start with a bottle of wine. Incredible flavors and they all worked so well together.
Split two entrees and we ate family style and had the Misto Mare and the 4 cheese Risotto Italiano Trio with added Italian sausage. Both dishes were extremely tasty and the balance of flavors made me want more and more.
The night will be a fond memory for the rest of our lives as the entire experience was impeccable. Cant wait to go back!"

"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michael G.","3.5 stars would be most accurate, but this place deserves the benefit of the doubt for 4 stars. The food is very good, and they use very fresh high quality ingredients. Pizzas are awesome and the salads are well constructed for superior flavor. An exception is their meatballs that left a lot to be desired. They were very small, dried out, and lacking in flavor. I also would prefer they use veal and/or beef, and not the added pork in the meatballs, as not everyone can eat that. Another challenge is that although the food is generally very good, their menu is extremely limited with not so many options. I wish they would add more fish and clams, or Italian style tenderized chicken/veal dishes.
It is definitely expensive. I recall some of the pasta dishes were around $24 a plate, yet they were also extremely delicious. I also really appreciate that they offer complimentary bread and olive oil, as well as delicious olives served at the bar. That makes the higher prices more worth it.
The atmosphere is excellent, and the service was pretty strong making the high prices more worth it. My only complaint on service is they served pizzas excatly at the same time with pasta dishes instead of phasing them, and it was too challenging to eat everything before items started getting cold. That was a big service miss.
When they have live music they definitely elevate to at least 4 stars!"

"Cafe Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Greg M.","I have not been here for a year or so. Six of us had dinner on a Sunday night. We were seating at 6:30 and things got really busy as the place filled up. Service was pretty poor- had to ask for bread to be brought to the table, took a long time to take our orders, and we waited at least 1/2 hour before our main dishes arrived. Service is usually really good here, so I'm assuming they were either understaffed or there were issues with the kitchen being backed up. Whatever reason, very disappointing for a place that has been around this long and should be firing on all cylinders.
As always, the lasagna is the best you can find anywhere. They have nailed this recipe for years, and it is always perfect. Very labor intensive to make it this well, and it shows. 5 stars.
Tried the gnocchi in vodka tomato cream sauce. Really excellent. An upper end Italian restaurant should not have gnocchi on the menu unless they know it will be perfect. This was as good as the best gnocchi I've had in Rome. Super light, great texture, flavorful sauce. As good as it gets.
Smoked beet salad, while not traditional, was excellent. Just the right amount of smoke flavor, well balanced vinaigrette that hit against the smokiness just perfectly.
Contorni of wood oven roasted carrots was the only real miss. Not cooked nearly long enough, they were served with a steak knife for cutting. The texture was not that far from raw carrots, and they needed at least 5 or 10 more minutes in the oven to help with the texture. Pretty flavorless and very disappointing.
To be honest, I was taken out for this meal and for that reason really enjoyed it, but if I had been picking up the tab I would have felt differently. Great Italian food in restaurants is understandably expensive- it is all about top quality ingredients and a kitchen that can execute without overdoing it. For the most part, Cafe Lago is still pulling this off, but this was not a slam dunk. If I go back I'll be sure to get the lasagna, which never disappoints."

"Bisato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bisato-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","John R.","We brought two out of town guests (Tucson and Chicago) to Bisato last night - the former Trattoria Mitchelli location, but the interior improvements are nothing like the old TM. A beautiful space, with the open kitchen divided from the main dining area by a counter filled with beautiful cured meats. The service, from start to finish, was impeccable. I liked our server's style, but at times his desire to inform us felt a little pushy. I am not a fan of being told ""you should order.."", but it was low key. I also found it a little confusing to have so many off-menu items that he explained, but they got a bit lost in the lively atmosphere. This is a ""hard surface"" space, so my personal hearing issues can result in me losing a lot of the detail from a soft-spoken server.
Service of the food was top notch. All plates were set simultaneously and without any mix-up in who ordered what. Likewise, finished plates were quietly whisked away when we were done.
Food quality was amazing. Everything was perfectly prepared, artful presentations, original flavor combinations and a treat for palette and eye. We had a lot of fun sharing small tastes with each other. Portions are reasonable, maybe running small for big eaters, but Bisato is not about the volume of food one can consume. We tried the bass, steak and marinated black cod and everyone loved their food. The ""hit"" was the gnocchi - a nice fat dumpling topped, atop and aside many other creative ingredients and flavor pairings. The other hit for me was the asparagus soup - a bowlful of the taste of spring!
For us, having a fine dining establishment in Pioneer Square as an alternative to Il Terrazzo is wonderful. We can walk there from our office and we plan on entertaining more clients and business contacts soon. I am pretty sure Chicago and Tucson will know about this restaurant as our business contacts are sure to talk it up. The dress, by the way, is Seattle casual - no pretense here."

I had the chance to dine at Bisato several years ago in the old location and fell in love with it then. So I was really excited when I learned that it was coming back. Actually, I was worried that it might not live up to what I remembered. But having been a couple of times now in the new location I can say it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The new space is gorgeous. The service is refreshingly great (somehow low key but still exceptionally informed and attentive). And the food always astounds, which is not at all a surprise as the chef is never not there. This is my new favorite Seattle restaurant.
I've been really fortunate to have traveled extensively for work in Europe and Bisato always strikes me as one of the most authentically European dining experiences I've ever had in the US bar none. It's hard to explain but there is a tradition of respect for ingredients and food that is so apparent in the food here. It's interesting though to look through the reviews and to see a few who just don't get it. Which doesn't really surprise me because this guy is cooking as if his life depended on it and most people aren't used to that. It's like he's using a whole different language of cooking. This chef is old school but manages to make the food surprising and new at the same time.
This food is about ingredients and flavor, not about heaping, torso-sized American portions. It seems to assume that after you've had several bites of something your taste buds acclimate to those flavors and it doesn't surprise anymore. So why not finish it up and move on to the next thing that is going to dazzle you?! I've never left Bisato hungry so I don't understand some of the smack talk here. If you leave this place hungry then you're doing it wrong. Order more food! You won't be sorry. There is not a better value in restaurant dining in Seattle - no - America....than having this guy cook for you! We'll be going back often."

I told him that it was a ""why yes it was, my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary"" When we arrived I reminded the host that it was a 50th wedding anniversary. They walked past the center table set for 8 and stuck us in a corner next to the kitchen. (That other table was finally filled with 6 people about an hour later). I think they looked at our mixed race family (white, black and Hispanic) and judged us that we shouldn't be in the center of their nice space. Another AA couple was stuck in a corner.
The waiter was nice but didn't say happy anniversary or talk to my in-laws at all even though I told him that we were celebrating such a big event. The host did not seem like he was making it special as I hoped the waiter would.
After we ordered appetizers, drinks and dinner (they forgot my steak knife and made my husband get up to finally get me one because my butter knife wouldn't cut it-I happily tried) the waiter asked if we wanted dessert. I said yes and he brought me a menu. I finally asked, do you do anything for ""special occasions because you guys asked me if it was and marked it on our reservation?"" He said 'oh yeah. We could give you a spamoni gelato ' ok. So I ordered a few more desserts so we could all share some.
Not once did this restaurant make our special occasion special. I told the young, dumb and broke host that his table choice was rude. We might not look like we are well off or tip well but we DO and even if we didn't it's their integrity in their service, (btw-I tipped 20% because it was work to serve 8 people and I'm not rude). Also my medium rare steak was not red at all in the center. I didn't want to dampen the night. I will be calling the manager but I doubt he/she cares. We shall see if they even respond on Yelp.
Update : the manager doesn't seem to care that we came for a 50th wedding anniversary nor that they asked but treated us like we should be sat by the kitchen and not treated kindly or like the special occasion that it was. My in-laws are the kindest people. Too bad no response. Changed from 2 to 1 star 2/5/19 after no response from the manager."

"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Trisha F.","I once turned down a date here because I was like, ""Uh, a mall restaurant? Gross."" My loss, because now I've finally eaten here I realize not all mall restaurants are created equal.
We came in on the late side for dinner, and our server was very nice and flexible with our annoying orders and additions--lactose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, just a lot of special dietary needs.
Ended up trying the cucumber cooler cocktail, Margherita pizza, Caesar salad, meat ravioli, and goat cheese flatbread appetizer. Family got the white chicken rigatoni pasta and the seafood sampler dish, which came with two kinds of fish, shrimp, calamari, and a veggie side. The dishes are expensive--more than 20 a pop so it adds up fast, but they were relatively good. I say I'd probably skip the ravioli next time. The pasta was too firm and there weren't enough to warrant 22.50 price tag. Since every main is about the same price, I feel like even the white chicken pasta bowl was a better deal.
The flatbread was good. Crisp and topped with tomatoes and red onion. Cucumber cocktail was weak. The best looking dish was the fish sampler. Pizza is typical Neapolitan, so soggy/soft and wasn't the best leftovers. Their bread and oil/vinegar is delicious--the bread has a great crust and the inside is so tender...it's delicious and wonderful for sopping up extra sauces from your main.
Overall I was happy with dinner and I'd come back to try other food and have wine over cocktails."

"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sharon G.","We were very impressed by this restaurant during our visit there yesterday.
We had a sleeping child in a stroller and were looking for somewhere we could take the stroller, unfolded, inside. They were completely understanding on this point and seated us in quiet corner with our stroller.
My butternut squash ravioli with fried sage leaves was excellent. The dish featured large, soft, homemade pillows of pasta and there was a circle of very fresh tomato sauce in the middle. They kept the fried sage leaves out of the sauce so that they were crispy and easily paired with a bite of ravioli. I especially loved that touch.
My husband's Tagliatelle Bolognese was very good as well.
Lastly, we were very impressed by the kindness of the staff. We would definitely make another visit in the future."
"Il Fornaio","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jesena M.","We've been here twice so far, it is close to Paramount and we park in the same building anyway. I'd love to give them a 3.5*, but I feel 3 is too low and they are not quite a 4.
We both had pasta and pizza both times, I wasn't too impressed with the pizza the last time, this time around was better. We both really enjoyed their pasta dishes (Penne vodka and butternut squash with brown butter and sage). We also decided to order an appetizer salad plate, which was nice, but could have used a little more something. It was plain lettuce with some parmesan shavings, I think a couple of tomatos, olives and other items could have added to it. The salad was too simple for the price we paid.
Service is always slow, we got seated and someone brought us water, another person a basket of bread and than no one else came for about 15-20min at least? We didn't know who our waiter was, so we emptied the bread basket and were just about done once the waiter showed up. He seemed stressed, even though there wasn't too much going on yet when we arrived.
Overall a decent option, but it isn't the high end italian experience I was hoping for."

The restaurant is worn. Walking upstairs to use the bathroom I noticed a terrible stench coming from the carpeted stairs that have clearly never been cleaned.
Bench seats and repairs with duct tape. Slivers abound with the worn tables. And they no long validate parking.

"Carmine’s","https://www.yelp.com/biz/carmines-bellevue-2?osq=Italian+Food","Helene L.","Food- very good Italian food. Portions are modest to fair, will fill you to content unless you order an additional salad , side or dessert. The bread is amazing crusty outside soft inside ciabatta from Central Market Seattle (per bus boy). I got the cioppino northwest, which was piping out with yummy seafood tomato broth. The gulf shrimp were huge and white fish buttery. Husband got the white clams linguini, which was delicious, wish it had more pasta, but we asked for 2nds on bread to sop up the yummy sauce. Rigatoni Bolognese is classic and nothing to rave or complain about, I would order it again as comfort food. The insalata di mista was seriously just greens, no tomatoes, cucumbers or additions. They will substitute the dressing to a lemon vinaigrette which was solid.
Service- very good!! Attentive servers who I feel like are real Italian. Server kindly split out salad order and kids order to 2 plates.
Ambiance- I categorize as upscale rustic Italian, with the chandeliers, white table cloth, exposed beam ceilings. Beautiful entry way flowers and landscaping decorations. They have nice velvet booths and large chairs. Great for a date, celebration to celebrate, not ideal for rambunctious kids. Goes well with the Italian theme, and the restaurant name itself.
Location- across from downtown park. Street parking.
Value- fair, you pay for the whole package, of service and ambiance.
Recommend- yes."

In natural fashion, we went back as an office for Happy Hour, because we were all still dying to try.
The ambiance is light, bright, open, chic and casual. The bar was full so we sat in the main dining area, where we were still able to order off of the Happy Hour Menu. Drinks for the table ordered: Manhattan, Aperol Spritz (only because NYT recently dissed them and we've never tried), Castleventrano Martini, and a great Red Wine pick from the bar manager. One of my coworkers knows what she wants in terms of taste of her wine, and they did a spot on job picking one out. All of the drinks were delicious and came out fast.
For food we ordered the Charcuterie Platter, Signature Meatballs & the Tuscan Bean and Kale Soup. Let me start with the Charcuterie platter, they say it is for 2, it's not, there were 4 of us and we barely finished it. It had a beautiful assortment of cheeses, meats, olives, veggies, etc. Everything was delicious. The meatballs (full order has 8 good sized balls), they were so flippin good. They do have a bit of spice to them, but I loved that part. Juicy, tender and an amazing sauce to dip the flatbread. The soup was delicious as well, jam packed with beans, kale and sausage goodness.
All in all, we all left satisfied. Service was amazing as was the rest. Will definitely be back to try some more dishes."

Pizzuto's is like every other neighborhood Italian-American restaurant that you can find all over the country. The menu is extensive, the prices are low, and the servings are very, very large.
The restaurant was filled to capacity by 7:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night, and it appeared there were a lot of locals by the greetings of the serving staff. Our server Rae was very nice, friendly, and took good care of us in the crowded setting.
One caveat is that like most Italian-American restaurants, canned olives are used on all the dishes such as the salads and pizzas.
We tasted three dishes, and they were all well-prepared and quite good.

"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Duncan B.","I wanted so badly for this place to be good. An upscale Italian restaurant would nicely flesh out the portfolio of Renton dining options. Unfortunately, despite a charming atmosphere, the food is just bad. Overpriced and bad.
My first visit I got the veal marsala and my companion got the chicken piccata. The veal was overly thick, unevenly cooked, and came in a watery, flavorless Marsala sauce. It tasted like cafeteria Salisbury steak. The chicken was somewhat better in so much as it tasted like chicken, but it was overcooked and tough. The Caesar salad was passable but certainly nothing to write home about.
I will give them credit for having a good tiramisu. Whatever bakery they partnered with is solid. Still, it was not enough to bring redemption to this establishment. Upon receiving the bill (over $100 for this debacle) I was filled with quiet rage.
Despite all of this, I foolishly returned to give them a second try. Nope. They sucked again."
"Sansonina Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/sansonina-ristorante-italiano-renton?osq=Italian+Food","Terri W.","We've been here twice now, and we like it.
Two dishes stand out for us: the Calamari Fritti, and the Tiramisu. My MIL got the Gamberoni Fiorentine which she really liked except that the spinach needed to be salted both times we were there. (They don't put salt on the table, so we had to ask for it to be brought, which is slightly embarrassing.) Hubs and I really love that fried calamari! We gobble it up like it's our last meal!
MIL also got the Chicken Picatta both times we were there, and she really loves it. Hubs did too. I got the Chicken Marsala on our first visit, and it was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. But in fairness to the restaurant, I need to explain. Many years ago, I tasted Chicken Marsala for the first time, and I fell in love with it. But I have never had one since then that tasted like that first one; nothing satisfies me. I'll optimistically order it on occasion, in the hope that I will love, it, but so far... no luck.
My recent main course was Alfredo with chicken. It was good, but the chicken pieces needed salt. The sauce didn't need salt, but the chicken did. (As I recall, the Marsala I ordered on my first visit also needed salt.) Hubby's recent main dish was Bolognese, which is often a favorite of his, but he said it was just okay.
On our first visit, we each got a dessert: the cannoli (no one really liked it very much), the raspberry-lemon tart (again, not that great), and the tiramisu (fantastic!). As far as we're concerned, the only dessert to get here is the excellent Tiramisu -- it's the best ever!
Both times we were there, we got seated at the same table, and had the same waiter. My MIL can be quite picky about her food preferences, and he was very accommodating. We appreciate that."

Service: The man at the counter kept on messing up our order even though we only ordered 4 slices. First he claimed that my friend only ordered one and wanted to charge her again for a second slice even though she clearly already paid over $14 for two slices. Then he kept on forgetting who ordered what even though half their pizza options were unavailable and we simply ordered 2 cheese slices and 2 meat lover slices. Though we clarified with him 3 times, he STILL tried to give me a cheese slice though I ordered meat lovers.
Price: $6 for cheese, $7 for anything else, +$0.50 for using card if your order is under $10 -- with tax my single slice was over $8, which is enough to get an entire pizza at MOD!
Food: Taste was mediocre at best and now my friend and I feel very unwell. I feel very queasy and dizzy. I will never come here again -- definitely do NOT recommend!"

I had their pasta cacio e pepe, and my husband had the butternut squash ravioli with pesto. For a counter service restaurant, I think the prices are way too high. The cashier was not very friendly at all, either. The food was just okay. You have to pay extra for things like $3 for pesto with your ravioli... that's a bit much. They also had Parmesan cheese containers in every table, and they were all empty. When we asked the lady in the counter if they had more, she just said to look for another one in the restaurant... not great considering that they were all literally empty."

When it showed up it looked really good. I took a few bites, and it tasted as good as it looked. Unfortunately, when I set the sandwich down, I noticed multiple hairs in the food. I pulled them out of the sauce. When I contacted the restaurant, the manager or owner basically said it wasn't his fault and insinuated that he didn't believe me. He did offer to replace the item and add a complimentary dessert, but wouldn't accept responsibility for the mistake, and continued to insinuate that I was lying. I turned down the replacement and was refunded by Grubhub. Their customer service and being called a liar is enough to keep me from ever returning."

First of all, the location is very cute. It's in a pretty neighborhood with a park across the street. Nice outdoor and indoor seating (some of the seats indoor have open windows with a pretty view of the neighborhood).
We went on the weekend (late Saturday afternoon) and opted for their small salad and pizza combo (note: it's only available until 3pm), which was a steal (I believe it was $14/person, but I could be a few dollars off). I got the beet salad and margarita pizza (extra crispy) and my husband got the caesar salad and pepperoni pizza with prosciutto on the side. We both LOVED everything! The beet salad was perfectly tossed in dressing and I loved the crumbled almonds. The pizzas were a smaller size on the combo special, so that made us feel a little healthier :) They were perfectly crispy with a perfect balance of flavors.
We also tried a few Washington wines. My husband got their cab and I got the red blend. Both of us were impressed! The red blend was very full-bodied and so smooth.
The service was great as well! Everythign was timed well with apps coming out and then the pizzas shortly afterwards.
If you are looking for a great go-to pizza spot, I highly recommend giving this spot a try!"

I was impressed that they brought hot sauce with breakfast, and no ketchup in sight, in fact, they dont even have it! Cute spot though. Glad we stopped by.

The fig salad may look small but it is not to be messed with. Super flavorful and we demolished it in seconds. The figs were juicy and went so well with the arugula.
The pizza was also pretty good- you can't mess up pizza. But really the star of the show was the lamb shank. With a hefty price tag- I cannot emphasize how great this dish was. Our waiter told us that the lamb shank is the only thing the original owner still makes and man is it good. The meat just falls off the bone. It's so flavorful and juicy and overall drool worthy.
The cocktails were really good as well! Very refreshing. The waiters have a good idea of what to recommend to you so I wold go with that.

When I moved from VA to Seattle couple of years back, I was looking for a local place that can offer friendly and professional staff with really homemade delicious food. I became a fan once I tried their food and pizza. Nadia always made me feel at home with her beautiful smile and wonderful service. Few months ago we went to the old address across from Alki beach and it was closed. I was so disappointed. I'm happy to say they Re-opened the brand new restaurant at new address 4717 42nd Avenue SW, west Seattle. I am going to try the new location very soon I have heard it's going strong with even better selection-cannot wait! This became a place of distinct flavors, experiences and memories for me since I have been here in Seattle.
The best part about the experience, in addition to the fresh and deliciously prepared food, is the family that owns the restaurant. They have a special gift and make you feel like you are part of their family. This is what makes Phoenicia truly extraordinary and like no other place in the junction or West Seattle.

Service was pretty nice
Food was not good this time. The garlic was so burnt on the carbonara I couldn't eat it. Pancetta seemed a bit old too. The owner asked if I wanted it remade which is cool, but I didn't feel like having anymore of that rich dish again. We got sick to our stomachs after eating the margarita pizza. All night.

We were craving for some pasta and saw that this was the closest one at walking distance in pioneer square. I would give this place a 0 if I could.
We were seated by an older woman who looked like might own the place given by her terrible and careless attitude. As you enter, there is no signage or check in booth, so you are left wondering how far deep you have to go into the restaurant to ask for help. We walk in a few steps and the owner gets up from a dining table similar to one that someone would keep at home - and comes up to us and ask us to be seated. The dining table was a mess, it looked like her office. There was a laptop, a couple of Starbucks cups and a stack of paperwork. We were sat right next to her table. And opposite from her - what seemed like her home office desk - was a mini bar. LOL - it was basically a buffet with a bunch of bottles of alcohol sitting there.
We sat down and were asked right away if we wanted anything to drink besides water. We asked for a drink menu and the owner said that she didn't have one ... we asked her to give us a few minutes. And when she came back we were still confused so we ended up not ordering a drink.
Our water glasses were FILTHY! We even told her that we would like a new glass, she kept telling us that "" they're not dirty, we just stack them on top of each other "" ok - the glass was literally cracked on the inside, it's like when you scrape a piece of glass against something and there is some debris coming off from it .. we then told her "" ok, can we still get a replacement glass "" she just made her way out - this was after taking our order. Her attitude was terrible that we ended up getting up and walking out of there!
What really irritated me was that she didn't care that we asked for a new glass to drink out of - or had a drink menu for us to choose from , and with her filthy attitude - they have the audacity to charge a 20% gratuity! No ma'am , I used to be a server and I got tipped for my service. And this place did not deserve a single dime.
I will not be returning. We didn't even get a chance to try the food, but the way you treat your customers is what matters most! I am surprised that they haven't gone out of business yet - it's just a waste of space in pioneer square."

I thought the wording and grammar means (present perfect) it is in the price already.
I was surprised to see that our bill came to $90 and it was an incredibly bad meal. Pizza swimming in grease, terrible lasagna and a suspiciously light tasting glass of red wine and one tiny appetizer.
I asked about why the note didn't say: ""... will be added"".
The owner was rude and said there is nothing wrong with the wording, and no one had ever mentioned it!! Well, then he never read his yelp reviews because 1 out of 3 reviews do mention it - as a surprise and as a disappointment.
1 star is a lot when (did I mention the service was rude and the water was lukewarm tap water? - which is kind of an oxymoron)
- the food is horrible
- the prices are high
- the portions are small
- the 20% tip is mandatory
We tried to order food that's hard to screw up. ""We"" failed. The only thing that didn't fail that night was taking our payment."

We started with a bottle of wine that was a little too acidic. After 30 minutes our appetizers showed up. Two of us ordered the mushroom arancini. It said foraged and found mushrooms. I guess the foraging didn't go well, because we didn't find any mushroom flavor. My wife ordered the local roots beet salad. They brought her the arancini as well and did not seem to believe her when she said she had ordered the beet salad. We all heard her say it. I am not sure why the waiter did not. Another twenty minutes and her salad showed up.
My wife enjoyed her salad. After another 30 minutes the entrees were served. My Braised Lamb was quite good. My wife's choice Bucatini Sarde was not bad. The other two in our party had the Chestnut Rigatoni. It was flavorless and the gluten free pasta was quite awful. They did not ask for gluten free pasta, that is all that was offered with the dish.
For dessert, three of us had the Theo's Chocolate Caramel Budino, which was very tasty, but served with a tablespoon that was larger than the ramekin.
In the two hours we were there, the waiter only spoke to us to take the original order, doubt that my wife had ordered the beet salad and mumble thanks when he dropped off the bill. Was it because we spoke Spanish or because of the order mixup? No, he seemed to be that way with everyone. He clearly did not want to be there. No problem, the place was half empty on restaurant week. We won't be back again. Soon enough he'll likely have his wish and not have to be there anymore."

The service was really slow even though there were barely anyone in for lunch, and in the two hours we were there our server didn't ask about the food once. We had to wait for while for our food too, and when he came back it was only to refill our waters and give us the check.
In terms of food, I had the daily special salad, which had an arugula and red cabbage base with almonds, figs, burrata cheese and grilled chicken (added for $4 more). I thought this was a very innovative salad and liked it very much - the only thing I was missing was a little more acidity from the dressing. I think they should have added a bit more of that. My chicken was also good but a little burnt, and they used chicken breast that wasn't boneless, so there was less meat than it looked like.
I wasn't able to take a proper look at the rest of the menu since we ordered rather quickly (the server came back very fast and my coworkers that had been there before us already knew what they wanted), so I might come back to sample that since I love Italian food. But it won't be my first pick."

Today is Mother's day, and so I defer to my wife for a review of our Mother's Day pick.
It was a Prix Fixe menu. 8 of us held a table for almost 2 and a half hours while we waited for the second course to show up. The food was cooked with varying degrees of quality. My wife was steamed. We won't be returning.
They waited until we'd already been put for 2 hours before they informed us that a cook hadn't showed. For that, I will leave the waiter with a tip:
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

The food was all cold. The salad had zero flavor. Some of the items had a strange after taste. One of the pre set dishes was no longer available. So they brought out soup instead. When I asked the waitress what kind it was, she was not sure and smelled it! The portions were extremely small and the sweet potatoes were under cooked. Everything took entirely too long to come out and when we received each course they were all slightly warm at best.
Aside from all of that, our waitress was extremely chatty and down right inappropriate. I won't get into what she said to me, but it was enough to offend me. At 115 dollars a person we all left hungry, disappointed, and I left offended. Over all this was the worst dinner experience of my 38 years of life."

When she said something, the waiter said that is how it comes, they did take care of her after she looked at him and said I can't eat this. After almost 2 hours our turkey finally came, I thought my first bite was raw so I mentioned it to the couple that was with us. When one of them shined his cell phone light on it, it was raw. He called the waiter in and he took it back to the kitchen. They offered us another plate but we were already going on 2.5 hours. The sweet potatoes were crunchy too, not at all cooked.

The sweet potatoes needed a glaze or something - they were just cut into non-uniform sizes and under roasted, hard and not completely cooked.

We started with the Caramelized Broccoli, toasted almond, chili flake, anchovy vinaigrette. This is a special of the house and it was excellent. The portion could have served 4....so we took home what we didn't eat.

The servers were at best nasty and unfriendly and should not be in this industry. There is no excuse for their behavior...
I cannot imagine how anyone could leave a tip.
Awhile later:
The owner/manager reached out to me and was very gracious. He reviewed my concerns and was very reassuring about addressing the matter in the future. So
I was very involved by his involvement.

Yes, the Italian food is delicious, the view is great, the wine is awesome, but the warm service and hospitality is what truly shines at Park Place. Really, the service was perfect.
The new owners, Corona and Daniel, understand what it means to be warm and welcoming to guests, including families. When we walked in on a Saturday night, a party of seven (including my 18 month old daughter and my out-of-town parents), they treated us like gold. Just one example of their attentiveness: they noticed that my kid was saying ""hungry"" and we'd run out of snacks, so they rescued us by giving her a mini plate of plain pasta to snack on before the food came out.
The ambiance inside is kind of romantic with white tablecloths, but honestly I'd rather have sat outside for the view. (It was too cold.)
The Caesar salad were really good. I'd definitely get one for lunch if I was in the neighborhood.
I came back today for a coffee and ended up having a nice chat with Corona. He mentioned that they're able to make a lot of the entrees vegan on request, which interested me because I have a relative who is vegan. I know we'll be back because not only is the food great but the people are too."

"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Joey J.","The food here can be either really good or just okay. The clams with chorizo was a giant portion and had good flavor but the grilled bread served with it was burnt. The arugula salad was bland and needed a bit more dressing. The sausage pasta was good albeit a bit too creamy. The fish of the day, halibut, was very good. I'd give the food a 4-4.5 star range. Portions were large so it negates the semi high price point.
Our biggest gripe was the service. We were seated and immediately given water and the menus. It took us about twenty minutes to be able to put in our food order. When the server finally asked us if we were ready, we had to ask if there were specials (which there were). I requested a drink that they didn't have an ingredient for, which was completely understandable, but then that caused an additional ten minute delay to get our drinks. Service was so slow/off that we decided against a bottle of wine because we saw a neighboring table pouring their own glasses and don't think that's acceptable for a semi-empty restaurant charging the prices they are with the ambiance they are trying to provide. Service improved towards the end but it was an issue to the point where it played into our beverage choice. $200 all in for a two person dinner and you just expect a bit more."

"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Cameron E.","Stunning contrasts - great view and great appetizers, but the service was almost comically bad and the mains were nothing to write home about.
Came here since it's a neighborhood restaurant for us, and we were really excited about the new opening under new ownership. Made an easy reservation with OpenTable and were shown immediately to a table on the front stoop. The host promised ""we'll be by shortly with waters.""
No waters appeared, but after some delay, a server showed up, noting ""oh, I'll be by with some waters in just a sec."" Five minutes later, she comes back to ask if we had menu questions, no waters in hand.
Finally get the waters and appetizers are in. She walked off without even taking a drink order - so I had to flag her down and order a glass of wine. It mean, it was comically bad that she didn't even ask if any one at the table wanted anything to drink, or wanted drinks before appetizers.
When the apps finally showed up, they were pretty good; we had the calamari that was sautéed with capers and olives, and a prosciutto with melon and arugula. While the portions were off in the latter (too much meat, too little melon) it was good, and we thought the squid was done pretty well with good balance of flavors.
After finally enjoying the apps, we were getting hungry for mains. Too bad the server was nowhere to be found... we flagged her down again and finally insisted on putting mains in. I found it offensive that I had to flag her down multiple times in the evening to keep the meal paced properly.
Meanwhile, the busboy came by and cleared everything off the table...almost aggressively. Then he completely failed to reset the table. When mains showed up, we got food before the table had silver, which is just amateur at best... if you serve food, you should be watching and on top of the table and what's on it at all times. This was clueless... and then when we did finally get silver, after asking and staring at our food, no steak knives arrived... and yet some of us had meat that needed to be cut. We had to flag the bus boy down, deal with the major language gap, and finally we got knives.
Mains were okay - a little bland and underseasoned; my veal was overcooked significantly, toughening it up. The folks at the table with pasta were hit or miss. Some were ok, some were more al dente than they should've been, leaving the pasta still crunchy in spots, not toothy.
Overall, probably not going back... food would've been adequate for a return visit, but the appalling lack of service creates an atmosphere that I would happily forgo. There's lots of places here along Madison that do a good job attending to their customers; I'd rather spend money there and get a consistent experience with good service...
Sad... I like Italian, but they just don't seem to have their stuff together in a way the looks rank amateurish at best."

The food and service have been consistently good. I really appreciate the breadth of choices on the menu.

Has a great selection of wine and the server was very attentive. However, the food was just ok. I had the veal and my friend had the chicken parmesan which was good but not anything amazing. Another disappointment was that they are listed on passports app as accepting passport. However, the waiter informed us they no longer accept passport since December which I thought was odd. Overall it was ok, not great not bad."
"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Vincent R.","It's okay. It was a little disappointing as far as serving size, i.e. calamari. Mozzarella di bufala was good, but it was served with unripe tomatoes. Pasta (linguine con vongole) was edible, but not worth $21. Chicken saltimbocca was uninspired and not worth $26. The gnocchi was best. Can't recommend this place, head back to Capitol Hill."
"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Fort D.","Decided to splurge for new year's eve with my bestie. And the best thing about Park Place, for us, was the cozy, traditional Little Italy decor. Warm, yellow light, railroad layout. Judging by the clientele, this is a beloved neighborhood eatery.
Sadly, the food wasn't very good, either in appearance or in taste, especially at 30-40 dollar plates. My bolognese presented as ragu from a jar atop overcooked spaghetti. Was flashing back to my high school cafeteria while eating it. Her catch of the day, swordfish, was heavily salted and its flavors squelched by too many seasonings.
Undaunted, we chose the marscapone amaretto cheesecake for afters. One bite each, and we put up our napkins. There was a chemical taste and poor texture.
To their credit, they comped the desert. The service was great, if you like the whole Sartre-ian waiter-faith thing.
We enjoyed our night, just none of the food. I hope they can tune up their menu a bit."
"Park Place","https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-place-seattle-3?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer B.","If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but I rounded up because the ambiance was wonderful and the service was good.
This place has a lot of potential and if I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably give it a second chance, but our first visit was missing some execution on the dishes we ordered.
My boyfriend had the bolognese and it was decent but not very saucy and rich like others we've tried.
I had the prawns and I was really looking forward to them because the description included butternut squash and truffle vinaigrette which are some of my favorite things! Unfortunately the prawns were really charred and over cooked, the butternut squash was hard and undercooked and I tasted zero hint of truffle.
The portion sizes were really generous, but for the price point and white tablecloths ambiance I would've expected more consistency!"

Bad Service!!
3rd Visit ... I'm so bummed I really liked this place but they have a serving problem. I originally gave this place a five star but on my second visit did not receive any service it was as if the serving staff were in a fight and no one was going to wait on this one table which is where we were seated. Definitely one of the most awkward visits to a restaurant ever. We waited so long we eventually had to excuse ourselves and leave with no service no one even tried to stop us to apologize. This was my husband's birthday. Prices these days are so high you can't risk inconsistency. I'll leave my original review below.
Food made with love in West Seattle. We had breakfast. Nice atmosphere! Windows open and fresh bread! Best mushroom frittata"

Something is always off when I come to this one, & this past Saturday was no exception. While the pizza was fine, the greens in my beet salad were so slimy. The salad had definitely been made far ahead of my ordering it. The music they were playing incredibly dorky & soft, almost Christian sounding pop. (According to Shazam, one of the bands was called The Script?) Unfortunately, it got on my nerves so badly, I had a panic attack. My brain chemistry is NOT their fault, but throughout the meal, we were both so completely turned off by the music. Why not just play some whatever downtempo instead of something some customers would find obnoxious? In all of the years I've been eating there (primarily at the one in Mount Baker), I've never heard anything like it. Imagine the soundtrack from a Hallmark movie. Luckily, my attack happened after we had signed our bills, & that was that."
"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Audrey C.","This is our favorite pizza spot in West Seattle.

"Mioposto","https://www.yelp.com/biz/mioposto-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Christina H.","After going to Mioposto in Mt. Baker, we gave the Alki location a try (it was closer to where we were staying anyways). It was also a good option, although the Mt. Baker location is in a way better setting. This one was at least not in the busy downtown Alki area, so parking was easier than we expected (but still took a bit of searching).
We ordered similar items as what we had at the Mt. Baker location (I got the beet salad, margarita pizza but I added mushrooms this time, and WA red blend; my husband got the caesar, pepperoni pizza with prosciutto on the side, but tried a medium colored nitro beer). The food was relatively consistent; something about the beet salad at the Mt. Baker location was better (I think the almonds were more finely ground and there were more beets). We also had to get normal size pizzas since we missed the timeframe for the salad/pizza special, and those were nice. I forgot to order extra crispy, so I highly recommend doing that (makes it well done all the way through - definitely way better!). The basil on my pizza was not shredded like at the other location, totally minor, but I wasn't as big of a fan of that. Also, the mushroom topping is called a ""mushroom trio,"" and it was actually just one kind of mushroom (crimini). Again nothing super big, but just a little confusing as ""trio"" means ""three."" My husband loved the nitro beer and said it was super smooth (I apologize for not remembering the exact name, but it was a medium brown and not hoppy at all).
The service wasn't as great as Mt. Baker. It might have been the time we were there (late 3's/early 4's). Our waitress was busy doing other things (appeared to be prepping for the dinner crowds), so there were long periods of waiting. We didn't mind since we were just relaxing. Eventually another waiter took over. Not the same attentiveness as the other location, but still not bad.
At the end of the day, the food was still great. If I had the opportunity to choose between the different locations, I think it's obvious what my pick is (Mt. Baker), but again, this location isn't bad."

The first time we dined in. Ordered 1 appetizer and 2 pizzas. The appetizer which had meatballs was impressive. Then the pizzas arrive. The dough was so chewy despite the bread being good quality. The execution was terrible and as a result we had an upset stomach the next day. It's possible they used the dough past it's expiration date because it didn't settle well in my stomach.
The second time we ordered pickup. I decided to give this pace another try. It was a mistake.
The second time the pizza was completely soggy. The pasta carbonara was unseasoned and dry. It tasted miserable.
A place like this in South Lake Union does not deserve to exist. And I am confident the reviews here are all astroturfed.
Please avoid this place at all costs. Yes, they have happy hour. But so does a dozen other joints at South Lake Union. I recommend against dining here."

The 5 of us ordered:
-Pizza of the day with prosciutto and burrata: voted as the best dish of the meal by the fiance. The crust is very well done and made in the wood fired oven.
-Mushroom pappardelle: my favorite dish of the meal. They put so much mushroom in there and the pappardelle is so fresh.
-Buratta salad: my dad's favorite. You get a very generous serving of buratta with the house salad.
-Side of cauliflower: a good side. Not a standout but good to get some vegetables in.
-Seafood on squid ink linguine: this was the first dish I chose but we all agreed they dropped the ball a bit. The linguine was way too soft and the dish overall was a bit salty.

It's kind of outdoorsy with tables and benches outside for you to sit. The best time to eat is lunch or late lunch, because in the evening, the flies start coming around. However, they do have space inside, but limited, so get there early. Service was great; the ladies that work there help you if it's your first time, and they are accommodating to your needs.

"Via Rosa 11","https://www.yelp.com/biz/via-rosa-11-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Mary D.","My mom and stepdad live in southern Italy (Capitello, Salerno) for eight months out of the year. I've been to Italy plenty of times. They have a traditional, outdoor stone pizza oven at their Italy home. My stepdad has been making pizza since he was a teenager, usually from scratch, where 'scratch' means 'the sauce is made from tomatoes and herbs he grew himself.'
We are tough customers when it comes to fresh-made pasta and brick-oven pizza.
So much so, in fact, that when they're in the US they usually avoid Italian food -- not just because it's usually too Americanized for their tastes, but because they will freely tell you they're kind of sick of it at that point, and sorta want a cheeseburger and a salad with ranch dressing.
My mother has actually suggested of her own accord when visiting me that we go to Via Rosa 11, which should tell you all you need to know.
The pizzas are thin-crust and a great size for one very hungry person, with potential for leftovers if you're not ravenous. *They also offer burrata.* I've never asked them if it's actual bufala, but it's so tender that it hasn't mattered to me enough to ask. On nights when I feel like splurging on comfort food, I pick up some fresh-made noodles and a container of one of their sauces -- bolognese is a personal favorite, and theirs never lets me down (get the wild boar bolognese if you're feeling especially fancy). I've bought a container of their meatballs in sauce and just eaten those for a meal with a salad. I enjoyed the meatball sub I had, but I can't speak as to the rest of the sandwiches, because when I'm there I'm not usually wanting sandwiches!
The only 'downsides':
1 - Limited seating. If they're slammed, that might present a challenge.
2 - The location means that I didn't learn about this spot until long after I wish I had known it existed, in spite of frequenting the feed store...and I imagine there are other people out there who haven't discovered it yet, either.
It's worth a trip. If you can swing it to hit Bay Hay & Feed and Via Rosa 11 on the same day, I personally think that those two locations alone are worth a trip all the way from Seattle and beyond."

Most of the people at our table got a meal to eat at the restaurant, and one to take home, which was a great deal. I had a lobster carbonara, and it was amazing with tons, I mean TONS of lobster. It was incredibly busy and we did have to wait about 15 minutes despite having a reservation. Sometimes the waiter would disappear and not come back for a half an hour, and other times he was checking on us regularly. Overall the delicious food and lively atmosphere made for a great Christmas Eve dinner, would definitely come back here again for a special night."

Friends and I just came back home after having a wonderful Sunday afternoon dinner out at Maggiano's. We so thoroughly enjoyed our selections, the service and the ambiance. Two of us could only finish half of our meal and asked for it to take home. We were so looking forward to enjoying the rest of it later. As it turns out our dinners were accidentally sent home with someone else. But, it didn't end there with an ""Oh, sorry.""
As an apology the manager ordered two complete dishes to replace what we lost and gave it to us nicely wrapped in a container to take home! Seriously, how many restaurants would do that for their patrons. Good deeds need to be recognized."

We also got seated right away as we did book online. (Booking online in advance is a smart idea because it seems this restaurant is usually busy)
The service was good, the wait for the food wasn't too long which is always nice!! Another thing I was very fond of is that they had everyone's food passed out around the same time, whereas other places do half the table than the other.
My friend I decided to do the meal for two: which was around 45$ including appetizer, pasta, pasta to-go, and dessert! For the price we got a lot of food and the quantity of each serving was more than enough! The overall quality of the food was tasty!!
And I wasn't aware that if you order a classic pasta you get the option to take one to-go which is super cool especially for families with kids!!
Also if you're wanting to come for an occasion we were allowed to bring our own cake and put on candles!
The overall experience was good, it was packed so it was a bit loud and crammed inside but despite that everything was good!
The only reason why I gave my review a 4-star was because we weren't given to order our dessert and considering there was ten of us, it is easy to forget so it's not the worst thing.."

My wife and I couldn't believe that they have been open for two years. We ordered from the wine list, a bottle yielded $5 off the full bottle and the Montepulciano was good. We ordered two appetizers that were okay, caprese salad and toasted ravioli. My wife ordered the carbonara, picky daughters ordered fettuccine alfredo, and I ordered the gorganzola pancetta gnocchi. All the entrees were delicious and the server told us the sauces as well as the pasta are all made in house. For dessert, we did the massive tiramisu, and I would have liked to try the baklava or something else next time too. The bill was not bad for all of that, and the service was incredible.

Our waitress was not much better, and instead of fire we got ice. She didn't smile once during any interaction and seemed humorless and unhappy to be at Delancey in general. At the end of our meal when my friend mentioned that the pizza should be labeled as spicy, she gave no apology and instead listed the ingredients.
To top it off, the pizza wasn't very good. Not that Delancey should be given a pass for rude behavior by making up for it with delicious pizza, but their pizza isn't even worth dealing with the unfriendly vibe."

Tonight was finally the night! We decided to order take out so we could enjoy our meal at home with our dog. We called in to make a to go order and the woman over the phone had a very rude tone and told us we cannot order over the phone we must come in person. This is pretty odd to me because the point of ordering to go is so you don't have to wait at the restaurant. We luckily live about 3 blocks away so we shrugged it off and went in to order. Once arriving there it was just a series of issues and utter rudeness from the hostess.
1 - messes up order; we ordered the sausage and the bacon and onion pizzas (2 separate pizzas on the menu), she charged us for a sausage pizza with bacon and onion.
2 - miss charges me; first charged us for 1 pizza with add-ons then charges us for 3 pizzas.
3 - messes up the void; doesn't void the original incorrect order; total jumped from $25 to $66
4 - fixes the void but doesn't provide receipt for proof
5 - doesn't acknowledge me when I ask for proof, just grabs the receipt and hands it to me; very cold, unfriendly, terrible customer experience.
The pizza itself was good. Nothing mind blowing or particularly unique. Perhaps it was over hyped to me, perhaps this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm giving this place a two stars because I was satisfied with my pizzas.
I've gone on this long without having Delancey and I'm fine continuing on the rest of my life not eating it again. I expected a much better customer experience and I'm highly disappointed."

Made reservations for our anniversary here after seeing a favorite chef post a photo from Essex (cocktail bar next door) and I'm so glad I found this place. The jersey salad and pizza may seem simple enough but truly, I would book a trip back across the country just to eat here again.
We tried Essex on two other occasions of this trip and not only were the cocktails incredible, the small(er) menu delicious, but the service was friendly and inviting. Our waitress the first night gave us a handwritten list of her must-see Seattle recommendations which we loved.
After visiting, I read the Delancey book, which I also recommend and loved being able to read the behind the scenes of how the restaurant was born and 5/5 would recommend the restaurant, the bar, and the book."

Now the crust is still as good as ever, but they burnt it quite a bit on our last visit. They replaced the interesting toppings (remember the kimchi) with generic ingredients. They also made a common mistake of overloading their pizza with cheese and sauces. It turned a once-beautiful crust very soggy.
Maybe I judged them too harshly, because they're held to a much higher standard in my mind. What changed for them? New management? Complacency? It could just be a really bad day, too."
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Camille J.","As someone who grew up on New York thin crust pizza, I'd say this is definitely some of the best I've been able to find in Seattle. My friend and I tried the bacon and onion pizza and the crimini mushroom pizza, and we both enjoyed the crimini pizza a lot more. The red sauce wasn't out of this world, so the simplicity of the crimini pizza was just right. Plenty of mushrooms for a nice umami flavor. Unfortunately, the middle of the crimini pizza was soggy. Still have a little more thin crust perfection to strive for.
This is certainly a popular restaurant. It was pretty bumpin even when we arrived at 9pm on a weeknight, and people were still coming in after us. Regardless, the service was excellent. Our water glasses were constantly being filled up (we arrived at the restaurant thirsty and were constantly guzzling down the water), and our waitress was prompt and friendly. Would recommend!"
"Delancey","https://www.yelp.com/biz/delancey-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mar B.","Good but definitely not the best pizza I've ever had- nor the best in the country. Go to the east coast or hidden gems in Sedona, AZ for that.
But know I'm biased because I like my pizza to have a lot of flavor.
Ordered the mushroom pie with pepperoni but when it
Came only had mushrooms, no pepperoni :( - waitress came around after 6-7 mins to check in on us, but honestly we were starving and waiting for our order to be corrected/remade was not worth the time.
Mushrooms were almost dry, like the way you eat them dry in a salad bar. They're kind of lightly cooked in olive oil, but almost just for a second. The pie was white with no red sauce, cheese and mushroom. Crust was white and kind of bland. Service from front hostess and our hostess was great, but can't make up for a boring pizza.
The addition of any kind of meat could have saved it, but alas white pie with semi dry mushrooms it was."

The food here is quite tasty and I would definitely go back to try some of their other dishes. The only other thing I think worth noting about this restaurant is that it is not cheap. If you are okay with that and want good Italian food, then this is definitely a great place to go.

We have gotten to know the owners and staff and they are always asking for feedback. They care about their customers and work very hard.
The only improvement I would suggest someday is if there is a way to muffle the noise of conversation. But that is a good sign that their customers are so happy and comfortable that the animation carries through the place when it is busy. They always have nIce blues or jazz or other music on low in the background and a silent tv with your favorite sports in the bar.
We have been to Brunch a few times too and all I have tasted is delicious as well."

The staff is great - they get to know the regulars and always have a warm greeting for regulars and non-regulars a like.
The bar is a good size (medium-to large) in a square shape with plenty of space and it has a TV (usually with sports) and a decent sized restaurant area that I often see friends or family dining. In the summertime there's outside seating as well. The parking isn't bad (except on a Friday night) but street parking is also available in the area.

"Saltoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/saltoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Laura V.","Their brunch menu sounded so good, so came here hungry on a Sunday morning. First, I really liked the interior and the seating arrangements. I had read the reviews before and knew it was a slower paced restaurant. So I came prepared with The NY Times.
There were about four or five other tables, so it was pretty slow there. My server was prompt and helpful.
I ordered a crab frittata and beignets. Opened the paper and started to read. The beignets came out after 20 minutes. They were good and I was hungry. They came with a berry sauce that made them a lot better.
But you don't want to fill up on doughnuts or you get that sickish feeling of being hungry and full at the same time. So, waited for my frittata.
It was another half hour before my food came. I'm almost finished reading the paper and reduced to reading sections of the paper I never read. And, starving. I wish I would have been checked on, to give me an idea of the status of my order. In a fairly empty restaurant, an hour wait for breakfast food seems too long.
The crab frittata here came in a cute cast iron skillet. But a cast iron skillet when I cook, is to impair a nice crust on the food. This cast iron skillet rendered the frittata into a brown scorched mass. When I saw that it was overheated, I tried to immediately scrape it all out of this pan, to stop the cooking process and see if I could save it. No, the entire sides of the egg had formed a stubborn hard crust on the pan. I almost wanted to cry with disappointment. I so wanted to eat that frittata. But even in my hungry state it was inedible. My server offered to have the kitchen make another one, but I can't wait another hour.
The frittata came with a nice fruit salad, including blueberries. But please take off those little brown stem parts off the top of the blueberries. It makes me think they were not washed, as you would notice the brown tops.
Came hungry. Waited an hour. Food very over cooked. Left hungry. This equals a sad experience."

The food was good but we were not offered bread, the portions were tiny and there was no salad or side veggies. We weren't asked if wanted ""to start with a salad"". I expect to take leftovers home in an Italian restaurant.
The decor is pretty lacking, and seating looks like home made benches - for how expensive the food is, the whole place could use some improvement."

This once-respected establishment has cratered under new management:
* rancid olive oil served with bread
* halibut obviously defrosted, came out looking like a cheetah had gnawed on it and discarded it (also: it was sitting in a half centimeter of flavorless oil - HARDLY the promised ""cognac reduction""
* lasagna was a watery soup
* plates were searingly hot yet pasta was somehow cold?
The charming and polite waitress would have been a lone ""pro"" except she described all of our dishes inaccurately and only carried one plate at a time. It took four trips back to the kitchen to bring out our two entrees and sides.
However I must admit a debt of gratitude to this restaurant. Their high-fat and rancid food made me feel so ill that I went to the emergency room later that night, where they discovered I needed an emergency gall bladder removal. Thank you Bistro

It was recommended by a friend and seeing the reviews I really thought it would be good. Apparently there is new ownership and it must be dramatically different than before because this is waaaaayyy over priced for what you get.
First off they didn't have any of the wine bottles that were listed in the menu. The waiter had to search all over for each one we asked for. He instead came back with an $80 bottle Syrah (that was marked up by $50). The waiter told us he would get us a deal on the wine but never did so. And he kept topping off our wine, who does that??
The service was fine, but the food was so mediocre. Way too much vinegar in the salad dressing, the bruschetta was bland. Our main courses were just odd. They were served on scalding hot plates so that the sauce on my pork chop was boiling. My husband had the most flavorless filet mignon. It was just such a disappointment. In the end we couldn't believe that we paid almost $200 for it all."

I called and talked to the manager once. It was an uphill battle the whole conversation and never once did he agree to take responsibility for mistakes that were made. He indicated he would contact me with a resolution and that never happened. I never asked for free food for two persons. I was the one whose dish was incorrect and you made it again and also gave me a portion to take home. What I took home was still not correct. It was my mistake in saying that the freshwater prawns were lobsters. That said, it doesn't take away the fact that one of them was half again the size as the other and if you have two people sitting next to one another ordering the same dish, it's rather awkward. Also, I didn't have a special request with my pasta dish, rather I substituted the penne with linguine because I don't care for thick pasta. It shouldn't have affected how you made the dish. Lastly, I never asked you to have Michael stay or run the business. I simply stated that when he ""was"" running the business it was much more hands on, he cared more about the quality of food, the presentation and would actually come out and talk to the customers at their table.

I enjoyed my octopus appetizer. When the waiter stated it was the most tender he'd ever had, I was skeptical. After a bit, without the familiar spring, I didn't know if I liked it. As I mixed it with the verde and hummus it certainly won me over. Similarly, I was skeptical of the quince on the Iberico Pork Cheeks. I was worried about too much sweetness. After the first bite I judiciously rationed out the fruit so a small piece accompanied every bite of the rich and tender meat. Can Panna Cotta be too smooth. I was promised one of the smoothest varieties available and again, the waiter was right. Rich and creamy with a tad of salt and pepper (?) mad it a joy.
I'm many spots, a meal this good comes with effort, by my kitchen-view seat afforded me a look at a quiet and efficient workspace. Relax, you're at Cafe Juanita. Breath."

The foie gras was seared to perfection. My pasta with caviar was heavenly. Everyone at the table was quiet for a few minutes after each course because we were savoring the entire experience. Even dessert!
Joshua was a lot of fun - he was attentive, knowledgeable, playful with one of our out of country guests...and we were grateful he was there to make our experience wonderful.

"Cafe Juanita","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-juanita-kirkland?osq=Italian+Food","Kathy H.","This might be my favorite restaurant in the Seattle area. The restaurant is tucked away in a quiet kirkland neighborhood. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the decor. The restaurant has minimalist decor with a homey vibe. We were greeted and seated almost immediately.
To start off the meal, we tried an apertivi (the somerset) which consisted of a delicious cocktail and a small amuse bouche. The menu changes often, but I understand they offer different apertivis every month.
We also decided to share a few dishes: the brussel sprouts, the butter lettuce salad, the tajarin with sage butter, the rabbit, and bombolini. Everything tasted amazing. All the dishes had so much flavor, and every dish was thoughtfully put together. I don't think I've ever been so impressed with a salad before! The plating and the flavors worked so well together. Also, your meal comes with a side of bread, and the bread plate was delicious!
One thing I appreciated the most about my experience was the staff. They were attentive and ensured that our anniversary celebration felt special. During out dinner, they were never overbearing, and seemed to time our dinner perfectly.
It was an amazing experience, and we would definitely consider coming back to cafe Juanita for another special occasion.
One thing to note: the parking lot is very small, so expect valet only. They allow you to take care of the valet cost with your dining bill, so it makes your experience very smooth."

It is some of the best food I have had in the larger Seattle area, and I think it's awesome that there is such a nice dining option hidden in the small downtown Juanita area.
The interior of Cafe Juanita is classily decorated, and the entire edge of the restaurant has continuous windows that somehow give a great view even though the restaurant is tucked between condo complexes. The wait staff is attentive and nice, but not overly stuffy. The atmosphere is relaxed for an enjoyable dinner rather than restrictive as some icier restaurants can be.
I've tried several small plates and main dishes. I enjoyed them all, even the ones I wasn't excited for but someone else at the table ordered.

She offered to give us a gift card so that we can try her restaurant again and we took her up on her offer. I will update my review once we give it another try.
I gave it 3 stars because even though the food and service was great, it was not a perfect night for the amount we paid to dine there.
- I reserved 3 weeks ago for last night (Tuesday 10/29). It was both my son and my birthday so we decided to combine both celebrations and dine here. I have been waiting 12 years to convince myself to pay this much money for dinner. We had to wait 15 minutes for our table. They knew it was a special occasion. - they even called to confirm that day. I was disappointi
- The place was packed for a Tuesday night. We waited another 25 minutes before the server greeted us. The water boy came refill our water 3 times before we could meet our server. We were starving - no bread nothing. The menu is hard to navigate. It is using a lot of Italian terminology so we had to Google the content of the menu because the server took so long to come and explain. I don't think it was the servers fault - it just felt they were too busy and maybe understaffed?!
- The food was very very good. Not quite my profile but I still enjoyed it very much. If Northern Italian fares are your thing, this restaurant should be on your bucket list.
Overall, for the price ($500+ for 2 adults and 2 teen) and paying $8 for valet, it felt too busy. They are a victim of their own success probably. They need to revisit their strategy for when guests get seated. Either have the sommelier explain the menu if server is too busy. I just think that 45 min after your reservation time to be able to talk to the server is not acceptable. Taking this one off my bucket list now :)"

I first found this place when my friends posted about it on the good ol' IG stories. I love Chilaquiles and immediately tried this place out the next day.
The pros:
Great portions and speedy service. You walk up to the counter to order here and bus your own dishes, so it's a very casual environment (which I like!). I've tried the Dicorciados Eggs (one of their chilaquiles based dishes) and also their signature dish, the Machacha de Res (shredded beef, potatoes, chilaquiles, eggs, tortilla, beans... YUM!!). Both are excellent! The Machacha de Res is splittable between two people if you're not SUPER hungry, otherwise, you will probably have some leftovers.
The cons:
Could have a bit more indoor seating, although the outdoor seating is heated and that helps."

Their taco truck gets 4 stars and the restaurant gets 3
Pros
- excellent service and friendly staff
- nice cafe setup
- Amazing tacos
Cons
- I ordered the chiliquiles and added some chicken.
It was ok. The chicken was tasty but having lived in CA and eaten a lot of Mexican food...it wasn't en par with what someone would have there"

I knew the food was going to be good from these reviews--I didn't expect the dining experience to be so nice though. The patio is lovely on a sunny day, and the presentation of the food is really elegant. The food itself is delicious. From the oatmeal to Rosita's eggs to the Machaca de res... everything was amazing. Also, the portions are BIG.
I am so happy Sazon Kitchen is here. Between it, Un Bien, and Watson's Counter, 15th is becoming the place to eat!"

Very quiet and empty when we went in, didn't think much of the ambience or why the place had so many good reviews - then we tasted their drinks. I got the Spanish G&T and safe to say it was strong and super good. Friends got a bunch of other stuff like their hot buttered rum etc, but this was by far the best on the menu. Recommend for a casual drink at the bar"

It's a peaceful place you can dress down at and enjoy amazing cocktails at, with a vibe very much like your favorite local watering hole. The biggest issue you'll have while going here is finding parking.
The bar has a unique decor, cross between classy and homely. The furniture is definitely dated, but adds to the charm. The place is pretty small and can't hold large groups. The ambiance is dark but not too quiet.
The cocktails here are phenomenal. I wouldn't call them unique or special, but the mixology is on-point. We tried three different cocktails, and all of them were really good. They also have a small beer and wine list, but those are high quality.
The service here is decent, but nothing to write about. You have to order at the bar, so there isn't any table service. On a Friday evening at peak times there was only one bartender taking orders and closing tabs. It can be really slow when crowded.
Overall, excellent place to go to for a low-key experience and good cocktails. Beware of parking constraints though."

Small, dark, beautiful. Perfect cocktails, every time. Most drinks rival any high quality $15-20 cocktail you'll have in New York or anywhere else. Order whatever is on the menu or ask (nicely) for the bartender to make you something based on what you like and they will make you something you didn't know existed that becomes your new favorite drink every time. This is one of the best places in town to grab high quality cocktails solo, on a date, or with a few friends.
Note: If you're someone that only drinks whatever vodka Red Bull trash you're used to getting at clubs, then this place is not for you."

Horrible service. The place looked very appealing on the yelp reviews and we had a group of five wanting to grab a cocktail on a Thursday night. We went into the restaurant around 10 and the server came to the table we were sitting at and gave us menus. He was beyond rude when we asked him what a specific ingredient was AND THEN when one in our group said which drink she would like he looked her up and down and just said ""yeah you can order at the bar"" as he walked away. We were dumbfounded at this service and sat for about a minute in disbelief. When we realized this was actually the service this institution provides we decided to leave and walk to the bar across the street.

Drinks are also good and I appreciate how they don't blast the music so you can actually have a conversation with the people you're with.
So why the 3 stars? It took a while for my brother-in-law to get the bartender's attention and once he finally did, was told that he had just missed happy hour... by two minutes. Customer service is huge to me and sometimes it's the minor details that make you want to return to an establishment so that was a bit disappointing."

Our pasta dishes and minestrone were all delicious and the service was very good and courteous. It was incredibly loud, so if you prefer a quiet place this might not be it. However, they were very family friendly and the food can fast and they had little activity sets for the kids. We loved it."
"Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - Wallingford","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tutta-bella-neapolitan-pizzeria-wallingford-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","H W.","This has been one of our friends and family's go-tos for a long time!! Great fresh food and friendly service. They are family friendly too, which is great for those with littles in mind. Their happy hours (afternoon and late evening) are awesome - lots of good things on that menu including $10 for a pizzetta (10"") which is perfect for one person (any flavor!) They also have a 13"" available. Their crust is amazing!! Wood-fired pizza at its best!
I am in love with their Margerita DOC (on days when I want simple and classic,) the Mediterranean (piled high with great veggies,) and a newly discovered favorite is the Roberto - extra virgin olive oil, pistachio puree, italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, smoked buffalo mozzarella, basil... YUMMMMM!!!!! And we always get the Beet salad - with pistachios, pickled red onion and goat cheese. So fresh and delicious! It's also on the HH menu for $8 - shareable size. Yay! And the icing on the cake? Awesome coffee, espresso drinks, desserts and gelato to wrap up a sweet meal!! You'll leave happy you came!"

They have a couple of wood burning ovens, making pizza where you can see them. The ambiance is very nice, it's a large space divided up into several sections. We sat at the bar, so we could watch a football game, had some drinks and shared one of their unique pizzas.
Added bonus- Daily happy hour specials. Plus, the Amici Club/App, offering points and $$ to spend!!"

Very casual but doesn't feel cheap or rushed... love that their tomatoes come from the base of Mt Vesuvius, and they try to be a little more authentically Italian than your typical large pizza place.

Everything was yummy but nothing wow and it was a little disappointing that we had hardly any meat in our tasting menu despite saying it was a preference.
Also took a long time between pasta dish and entree...they were busy so I actually think they might have run out of what was going to be our entree.
The cocktails were some of the best I've had!
Definitely a cute date spot and novel approach but if you know what you like there are restaurants where you get more for the price you pay."

The first time I came to staple and fancy was during Seattle restaurant week and I'm so glad I did. They had 5 appetizers- to share and then main course and dessert. The food was EXCELLENT and service was great too. Since then it has been my go to place for a date night or celebrations and the food has always been amazing!
The wait mostly isn't long but it can get pretty busy on the weekends. There isn't much to do around, since it's on the less busy east end of Ballard ave. But on the plus side, it's easy to find parking. I recommend making a reservation to save time.
If you haven't been here yet, I HIGHLY recommend it. One of my most fav restaurants in Seattle!!!"

It included 5 appetizers, a pasta entree, and a dessert.
The appetizers were probably the better part of the meal, our favorites including the chicken liver pate on toast and the fried oysters with aioli. For our pastas we got the pappardelle and ravioli and felt they were both very average. The pastas had good flavor but a little too much acid, making them rather underwhelming. Dessert was a hit and a miss, the pumpkin cheesecake was velvety and wonderful whereas the peach upside down cake was dry and dense.
The service was lovely as our waitress was very attentive and all of the staff was friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was cozy and warm, especially inviting on a rainy night. Overall I'd say it's a nice place for date night but nothing special enough to splurge over."
"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Matt S.","Although we had reservations, we were sat at the bar. The three of us in our party had the tasting menu.
The courses that came out were all pretty breath-taking and i would recommend as a highlight for anyone looking for a spectacular meal.
What impressed me the most was the kitchens enthusiasm and willingness to send out multiple items and custom items not on the tasting menu which aligned with our preferences (i'm not an organ meat fan) so they worked around me but showered my friends with pate.
I really can't wait to go back and be treated to another amazing meal!"

"Staple & Fancy","https://www.yelp.com/biz/staple-and-fancy-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Wendy K.","I've been to Staple and Fancy for fancy before I started writing reviews regularly. Had a chance to go during Restaurant Week earlier this week. Had friends visiting from out of town who love good food and don't like chains, there were five in our party. I gave them about three suggestions and they selected here. Worked out perfectly it's close to home and had been way to long since I had dined here.
They do things a little different here. The appetizer course of the RWS menu is served family style, so instead on just one item to select from they bring you a number of items. I think our favorite was probably the fried oyster with Calabrian chili aioli. There was also a little espresso cup of potato and caramelized onion soup for each of us, house mozzarella served with romesco, almonds and arugula, been tartare and baby gem salad.
I selected the grilled swordfish as my entrée, the others ordered at our table were the Strozzapreti and Pappardelle. Fish was cooked perfectly and just the right portion it came with corona beans, salsa verde, orange and frisee the acid and freshness made it a wonderfully balanced dish. My friends were leaving the following morning so I was able to take their leftover stropzzapreti and pappardelle home. Both pasta dishes were delicious and that was the day after.
Think three of us had the Pear Chiboust and two had the Fudge Cake for dessert. We also added the red wine special for $35 for table. Service was excellent the staff is well informed not only about the food but the wine as well. You can tell they personally have sampled the wine and dishes by the way they explain things. I've always loved the space, warm and inviting. Also appreciate that they have it on the menu but also are very clear to inform you that the gratuity is included in the price. Hopefully I won't wait so long to go back again."

We came in here for the first time after a day of manual labor (we cleaned up first), looking to have a filling, delicious meal after an exhausting day. We clearly misjudged that Staple and Fancy was the right place to do that.
The host barely looked at us. The server was snide, clearly annoyed that we were under dressed, young, and only ordered mains. We spent $70 on pasta that was good, but not worth the side of snark.
I have never felt so judged by a place I am paying money to be, by choice. Message received! We'll go elsewhere for our staple dinner needs and definitely for our fancy ones."

If you're planning on going on a busy night I would recommend reserving a table, we waited at most 5 minutes for our table. I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday and I appreciated how the staff acknowledged the note on the reservation and made special accommodations for us. The birthday boy even ended up receiving a free dessert which was an unexpected but welcome surprise.
The reason why I gave this place only 4 stars was because of my food. My friend got the fettuccine with clams and thoroughly enjoyed his food because it was piping hot. Me on the other hand, ordered the Campanelle and my pasta wasn't warm to the slightest bit. I know my pasta was probably done before my friend's but I wish there was someway to keep dishes warm so we both could have enjoyed our food. That being said the dish itself was tasty, it just would have been tastier if warmer."

The dish from Piatti ended up being one of the highlights of the meal. One guest referred to it as the best he'd ever had, and I was asked to make sure to put this item on the table again next year.
This took a lot of stress off my back, and I am looking forward to using Piatti's catering services again for my Christmas meal.

"Piatti","https://www.yelp.com/biz/piatti-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Allison C.","Overpriced, mediocre pasta.
One of my boyfriend's favorite foods of all time is squid ink pasta. So, when we heard this place served it, we decided that we had to come try it for ourselves.
Atmosphere: Probably the best part of our experience. We came in on a Wednesday night. Our area by the windows was peaceful and sparsely populated, making it the perfect location for a nice, pleasant dinner.
Food: I ordered the gnocchi while my boyfriend ordered (you guessed it) the squid ink fettuccine. I was so incredibly let down by the gnocchi. It had no flavor whatsoever; it was like I was eating tasteless carbs. It was my boyfriend's first time ever trying gnocchi, and he was let down by the experience as well.
The squid ink fettuccine, on the other hand, was delicious. However, the quantity was minimal. Despite also ordering a basketful of bread to share between the two of us, my boyfriend was still hungry after eating half of the bread basket plus the fettuccine. At the price point of the meal (discussed shortly), I don't think that should be happening.
Price: It was $16 for each plate of pasta, plus around $3.50 for bread. Combined with tax and tip, we were looking at over $45 for a meal that didn't even make the two of us full. Yikes.
Service: We received our food pretty quickly after ordering, which I appreciated. Our waiter was pleasant, but didn't go out of his way to be extra personable.
Overall: Try another pasta joint for better taste and more bang for your buck. I will likely not be back."

The meat and cheese plate? Needs help. It wasn't even about the meat and cheese that comes with the plate, those were great! The brie and fig jam along with grilled bread was fantastic too.
But the sides they added with it was just odd to me. It really brought the experience down. Instead of some nuts, or pickles or crackers... they give you beets??
Beets!?
No. I do not like knowing what the earth tastes like. Thank you.
Also, the pickled veggies I was excited about was actually carrots (only one slice) celery (fine I'll eat it) but then get this... onions. Pickled onions. Not even the purple kind you may find on a fancy taco somewhere. Why would anyone want to eat pickled onions like that?
I may be in the minority here with that one. But I haven't seen it before so it threw me off.
The place itself was awesome. Staff professional and classy. Place was empty when we got there but jam packed by the time we were done. There is definitely a lunch rush here.
One last thing. Lift weights before you come to eat here. You're going to need extra muscles to open that heavy ass door."

I arrived at 5:30 and sat at one of the high tops in the bar/lounge area, where happy hour is served. The female server came by to ask if I was waiting for anyone and I let her know I was. She wasn't what I would deem friendly in any sense of the word, but took my drink order and came back with in shortly.
My friend arrived about 15 minutes later and we placed our dinner order. Again, the server was less than warm and friendly. We ordered the margherita pizza, arancini, and salad with prawns. The food was very good. Unfortunately the service being less than welcoming, and the prices being so high (happy hour isn't so much a deal as much as regular dinner prices) will deter me from returning in the future."

"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Robert B.","This might be an unfair review. I reserve the right to revise up.
THE ROSES: Truly excellent pizza. Pizzas are made in a wood fired (apple wood) oven in the back on the dining area, and they're done in the Neapolitan style. Large selection of pizzas featuring what appear to be only the finest in toppings. Classic Italian and artisan styles; don't even THINK of asking for Canadian Bacon and pineapple here. Good selection of top-quality and rather creative appetizers and salads. Remarkably pleasant and professional staff, especially when you consider that they'd been slammed on a Friday night for probably at least five hours! Remarkably decent prices, when you consider the neighborhood and the quality.
THE THORNS: Dining room is a bit loud, and I wasn't crazy about the hip-hop heavy playlist. The big deal is that they really need to work on the estimates for wait times that they give. Our one-hour wait was more like two hours. Good thing it was Art Walk night, so we had something to do!
WHY TWO STARS? I really think they could've done a better job with estimating the wait times, or at least acknowledged that they kind of sold us a bill of goods. I realize that this is more art than science, but I think they could've done better.
TOP TIP: Look into trying Yelp's 'Waitlist' feature. Give people an opportunity to hang out on their boat for cocktails while they wait for their table!
THE VERDICT: Superb pizza that is worth the wait, but only just so. Tread carefully, my friends: you're the only game in town right now for top-tier pizza, but if you continue to leave patrons waiting for hours, someone could come and eat your lunch. Just sayin'..."
"Bruciato","https://www.yelp.com/biz/bruciato-bainbridge-island?osq=Italian+Food","Andrew M.","This place is legit. It's a 10 minute walk from the ferry stop and you're going to get fast service and fresh artisan pizza.
From a design standpoint, the restaurant is beautiful and elegant. Colored vases line the walls toward the pizza oven with an intricate white tile exterior. The food was amazing. The margherita pizza was good and checked all the boxes, but nothing exciting about it. The funghi was delicious. The generous amount of mushrooms added a crunch in addition to it's earthy flavorful profile. And the cipolla was something I've never had before, and I'm so glad I tried it because now I will be looking out for it at other pizza places. Honey and sheep cheese, straight up magical...
Margherita - 8/10

It was a Saturday night so they got a huge rush of people toward the end of our meal so the check took an extra 10 minutes or so."

We are graciously greeted at the front door aNd quickly sat at a booth. Water was set down quickly and drInk order taken promptly. The food, OMG, the food. We started with the Calamari with the aioli and let me tell you something, that aioli is outstanding. We also got the Paella and it was phenomenal. Filled with calamari, muscles, clam, shrimp, salmon, sausage and yes rice!! By this time we were to full for dessert but ordered anyway. To go of course. Not really a place for ourr 5 year old but may take him when he is older as he loves noodles. The waiter was amazing and friendly.

Back on Valentine's day I got a rock about two inches around served in my very expensive seafood dish. Made server aware of it, and they acted like it was no big deal. ""Oh that happens sometimes."" Fortunate for all parties concerned I didn't bite down on it. Food was ok. Didn't make a fuss because it's Valentine's and didn't want to ruin the mood.
Fast forward last week, go to the bar, order a dirty martini. Served with no olive juice. Asked why. They were out. How are you going to serve a drink without all the ingredients? And you knew you were out. Was then charged $14 for the one drink. Between the two that's enough for me not to go back and post this as a warning to would be restaurant goers.
Tbh more annoyed by the bartender deciding to pass off a drink she knew wasn't what I ordered."

We were able to try two different wines which both were great with flavor. We were also able to try a cheese spread laid out with heirloom tomatoes and balsamic drizzle. Now the showstopper obviously were the two different pizzas we got to try. The Delux was my personal favorite. It came with sun dried tomatoes, pepperoni, sausage and goat cheese. Yum. The Burrata was also very tasty. It included a squash base with Kale, olive oil, sea salt, and burrata. Very different and unique but really quite tasty. Last but not least for dessert we were offered Tiramisu which was delicious! It had a very strong coffee flavor which I loved. This is solely a pizza and salad place so don't expect anything else. The pizza is on the smaller side for me (I could probably eat a whole one myself) but tasty.
I love the interior and the atmosphere of this place. It is a very tiny place though, there is no way you can fit more then 30 people in the restaurant but it has a very nice intimate vibe. Love all of the natural lighting and in the summer there is an option to slide open the front window to get a breeze and sit outside in the patio. The staff and owner were so pleasant I definitely would come back here again. Prices are a little toward the higher side but you're paying for the experience and the experience was out of this world. I definitely recommend for a date night or intimate gathering with a few close friends."

It's not like they were slammed.
What really bugs me, the waitress came by twice to how things are going, but never once said anything about my salad.
The couple in front of me got their order pizza and arugula salad within a reasonable time and we were there pretty much there at the same time and ordered within seconds apart. WTF! I finally got frustrated and ask to be cashed out my $6.61 glass of wine and left her a $2 tip.
I'm a pretty good good tipper, but they/she was not worthy of more.

They have 2 beers on tap, both served in wine glasses. So more like 8oz.
The tables were really small and the ambiance was lacking some. Would have liked a little more space in between tables and the lights more on the dimmer side.

We started with a glass of Prosecco.
The bread was served warm and it was so delicious.
I often say you know how good the food will be by the bread they serve!!! We ordered the halibut Special of the day and the seafood linguine with marinara sauce ...both dishes were to die for!
So tasty ! The seafood linguine reminded me so much of the dish in Rome..delizioso!!! We ended the meal with our favorite cappuccino. We were too full to order dessert...perhaps next time

Call me silly, but I love the starched tablecloths and napkins. I love the sweet, street-front locale. I love how the waiters seemed to actually pick up on when we were deep into a conversation and wait before dashing in with whatever ""special"" was oh-so important for us to know in exactly 12 minutes after we were seated.
It is the epitome of a lovely bistro. The Caprese salad was fabulous, topped only by the Stracciatella Alla Romana (an amazing soup, just saying).
Seriously, it is delightful. Stroll past the super-cool art galleries, step inside for a wonderful meal, what could be better?"

The atmosphere was so chaotic and obnoxious. Servers kept running behind our table to grab things and running back. I just could not relax in this environment.
Our server was rude and did not even attempt to engage with us. I only liked the young bus boys who appeared to be teenagers. They were hustling HARD and the only kind souls who cared. I feel bad that they are probably so underpaid when they are doing more work than our lazy server who could care less about us. My additional star is for them!
The gorgonzola fettuccine with chicken was so salty and the sauce was way too rich. I could only handle a few bites before asking for a to-go box. I honestly prefer Olive Garden over Ristorante Paradiso."

We had a reservation for 7 pm, but as we entered we saw a crowd of people waiting at the front door and once we checked in, they told us they are running about 30 min behind schedule...yikes...not something you want to hear, but it was a very busy night for restaurants in the area so we weren't too mad, plus they had a great attitude about it and were very apologetic.
We got seated and a bread basket was placed on our table with some butter which I have to say was THE BEST free bread I have ever gotten at a restaurant. It came right out of the oven, still super hot and crunchy, but fluffy on the inside. I ate way more bread than I should have. We ordered the Antipasto All'Italiana meat, cheese, and marinated veggie platter which I liked, but I thought could have been presented in a more elegant manner. I also ordered the lobster tortellini which was very delicious, cooked well, and had a wonderful cream sauce...although it was a bit pricey. There were 5 pieces of tortellini and the dish cost $28 dollars. For dessert, we ordered the sour cream cheesecake with raspberry sauce and it was SO good, it tasted like it was home made and the raspberry sauce was so fresh and delicious.
The restaurant itself has a great vibe. It is on the small side, but feels very cozy and intimate. It really reminds me of a restaurant you would find in Italy.
Overall, once our waitress got to our table she was very friendly, got our food out to us quickly, and was very lovely to us despite how incredibly busy they were. Although there was a bumpy start at the beginning, in the end I felt that his restaurant did a great job with food and service.

I'm happy that the gentleman had mentioned they have a storefront, and after googling I found that it's not far from my house and conveniently on my way home from work.
I've tried the fresh egg pastas, a few raviolis, and tonight picked up some kale pesto!
The kale pesto was delicious, creamy and had a nice kick to it.
The pasta is fresh, and keeps very well in the freezer if you ever find that you want to stock up for a few months during off season for farmers markets. It cooks up very nicely, and even when reheated the texture stays nice and chewy

- Lively ambience.
- Eclectic and very tasty food.
Not so good:
- Community seating, meaning you'll share a table with strangers. I've seen this at some other joints too, but here, there's very little personal space among parties. Depending on who you're sitting beside, this can be an annoyance. My friend and I were sat adjacent to a group who clearly work together. How do I know? Because they were obnoxiously loud and inconsiderate of others.
- Servers not very attentive; no one refilled our water bottle.
- Not all servers are friendly. I asked for a clean plate for the 2nd item we ordered, and the server seemed reluctant in doing that.
- Price is slightly on the higher side. But that's not unexpected from a popular eatery in Seattle.

Holy CRAP Burien! Don't tell the others....don't spread the word that this place exists.
I can't believe I have finally found a place that actually gets pasta. Like, truly gets it. This place is pretty much the pasta whisperer. I had the Gorgonzola thingy, Mozzarella rapini, and some glorious pizza that had arugula in it. I'm still salivating and its been almost 24 hours.
This place is not only a gem, but should easily be in some sort of America's best pasta places top ten list. For real."

By the end of dinner the check was slightly tossed on the table and the waitress/owner walked away! She didn't even speak to us?!? Not sure I would recommend this place before giving it a go one more time, maybe she was having an off night?
The owner (gentleman) is such a pleasant and gracious man. His greeting was warm and inviting. I learned he is also the chef which makes sense why the food is delish; his kindness and generosity definitely spill over into his cooking."

"Osteria Da Primo","https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-da-primo-burien?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff D.","We have lived in Des Moines for 22 and just found this place. It will now definitely be a go to place for us. Everything was great! The only thing I could say for improvement is they give you so much calamari on the order you might run out of the yummy aioli, not that you really need it, it's great all on its own; well seasoned. Best calamari we've ever had! And the bread is very good, might be a bit better if slightly warmed. The salads were great, in fact the Insalata Primo is great with some calamari added; the lemon vinagarette goes well with the calamari (I know cheese and seafood shouldn't mix).
On the surface it may seem to be higher priced than the surrounding area, but they have good sized portions and much better food than most in the area. They offer the full multi-course Italian meal, though unless you are sharing the pasta and main course I don't know how you could make it to dessert?! We stopped at pasta and got tsiramasu to bring home. My wife had mushroom and pancetta gnocchi and said that the gnocchi was ""life changing"". I had the spaghetti with seafood; some places you get a very little seafood. I had 5-6 huge shrimp, a dozen steamer clams and 1-2 Calamari, all perfectly cooked and combined in a great tomato sauce!
Most of the reviews are very positive, the only few negative ones I've seen are about service. I give no credibility to those. Its a small place, not much staff, I could see a very needy/demanding diner feeling ignored when they are busy. You will get good polite service and have the best Italian food in the area so give it a try you won't be disappointed."

It was executed well as everything was pretty flavorful, and tasted fresh.
I also thought the service was superb. The server checked up on us a few times and there was another server that made sure our waters were full and took away dishes when we were done. Everyone was pretty friendly as well.

Buffalo pizza, calzone and clam pizza were all incredibly delicious
Service good
Cons:
Too dark of an ambiance for me.
Food is not only about satisfying the hunger but also pleasing the senses, which is extremely important for overall satisfaction.
Beautiful colors of freshly and masterfully cooked ingredients pleasing to the eyes are just as important as smell, texture and taste. It was too dark to see my food.
My recommendation would be to increase lighting a bit where it's still a pleasant atmosphere and customers can take advantage of good lighting to actually see the beautiful creations of the chef. After all it's not a bedroom, it's a dining room."

The pizza was supposed to have mozzarella on it, but instead came cheeseless with arugula instead. Rather than offering to comp the piZza or make a new one, they have us 25% off, which felt paltry. Our server was very helpful and prompt and gracious, but it felt like he was trying to swim upstream with a poorly run kitchen and grouchy management.

I politely made my note to the waitress, and she literally ignored what I was telling her.

"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Linda L.","Honestly, I've lived walking distance to this place for over a year now and I never thought of stepping in because of my Starbucks bias... Why go to a large chain when there are all these small coffee shops around town?
Well, I walked in one day and had a foccaccia pizza and a pastry, and lemme tell you, I was back the next day for more. The pizza especially is divine, and I really recommend it.
Now I'm a huge fan of this place!"
"Princi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/princi-seattle-9?osq=Italian+Food","Patrick V.","ATMOSPHERE: Clean, feng-shui, elegant but warm and inviting. Not crazy loud even when busy. Large high-top community table, a few solo window benches and then a bar side, cafe-style dining room. There is food in a hot case on display, then a coffee bar, then an alcoholic bar.
FOOD: The pizza is insane good, unique and a once in a while treat, as it is quite oily and buttery. Non-traditional style as they are square and without tomatoe sauce. One large slice they cut into 8th costs $8. Well worth it in my opinion. The pastries look lovely as do the bread loaves however I cannot vouch for them.
Espresso is nice as it is an offshoot chain of Starbucks Reserve. No order too strange or difficult for them and the taste is smooth, rich and well crafted.
SERVICE: They are usually pretty slammed as it is right in the Amazon torn butthole of Seattle but the cafeteria-style line is efficient.
PRICE: Average for the area."

The line winds in front of a case which has sandwiches and pizza in it. I ordered a small sandwich to split and a piece of the Funghi Pizza. After sitting down (Beautiful wooden seats), I noted there was also salads and pastas further down. Maybe they should put those more visible (I though sandwich and pizza were my only options). Will have to try those next time.

The bad: small portion sizes, more meat than vegetarian options, no free bread!
It seems more and more that gone are the days Italian/Mediterranean restaurants offer a complimentary bread basket with butter (as they should) and instead shrink portion sizes to ones suitable to that for a 10 year old. Trendy vibe hipster places like to act all ""people over profits"" but nope, they care about profits just as much as the nearby McDonalds. Sigh.
We ordered a few dishes: the yukon potato gnocchi, roasted heirloom carrots with cashew cream, roasted broccoli with tahini sauce, grilled octopus, fresh mozzarella pizza, and the apple crostada. The gnocchi was a tad bland, and we finished in only 4 bites (!!) Carrots were interesting. The ones that were cooked well had an amazing flavor with the cream, but many were burnt so we sent them back and they were removed from our bill. My friend has dined here before and made the comment that they put less cashew cream this time than in the past. We loved the broccoli, and the octopus was impressive, as it is hard to cook octopus well. The fresh mozzarella pizza had a nice thin crust, but I thought it could have used more a bit more cheese on it. But that's just because I like a lot of cheese on my pizza. We loved the apple crostada."

We just went again last night (Saturday at 7pm) and were able to get a table almost immediately. You can also book on Open Table if you want to make reservations on your phone.
The decor is a dark restaurant with a lot of candles with wax dripping down them. There's a really nice looking stocked bar and it's a cozy kind of feeling. Also, on Valentine's Day they have had a live musician playing music, which was really nice.
The food is consistently great here. Some of my favorites are the grilled octopus, Saganaki (a kind of grilled cheese with pita on the side), seafood (lobster) risotto, and the lamb gnocchi. Those are definitely my favorite items. There were 4 of us there last night and we just ended up sharing everything which was great! Just a note: The menu can change with seasons, so you might want to check what they have online before going.
Grappa's signature drinks are different than ones I've had at other restaurants. I was surprised that they had a Johnny Walker Black cocktail which was very good (not too sweet). They also have a tasting flight of the different Grappas they have, which is good if those who want to try to drink.
The service has always been consistently great. The waitress made great suggestions on what to order. She also consistently came by to check on us and refill our drinks.

We spotted this gem and decided to give it a try. First thing we noticed, the Excellent food rating on the door...my husband loves this! Before Washington started this law, he visited New York, where this was ALREADY law and loved seeing the ratings on the door...made it easy to choose which ones to go into and which ones to avoid! Wasn't busy at all, they had just opened up, so we had our pick of the litter. Choose a booth by the window! Restaurant is very clean, not run down, but not brand new, but had a ""homey"" feel to it! We were welcomed by a very nice lady that had a very thick Greek accent! I ordered the manicotti with meat sauce, & a salad, hubs had the chicken parmesan sandwich with a cup of soup!
We get our order, my husband takes a bite looks at me, closes his eyes and says ""don't talk to me for a minute""....I know what that means! he said it was one of IF NOT the best sandwiches he has ever had! Chicken was seasoned perfectly, good sauce, but it was the bread that did it...lightly toasted inside and nice a spongy soft on the outside, but not soggy...HE LOVED IT !!
My manicotti was great, cheese was flavored good (some restaurants the ricotta is just bland, not this case) Piping hot and delicious! My salad was awesome as well...crisp lettuce with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives with mozzarella cheese and tons of blue cheese dressing!
Bill was completely reasonable, we walked out of there under $50 with tax and tip! We live about a half hour away, but we will be back!!!"

Saw this joint on the maps and it had good ratings. So we went down and gave it shot.

We sat down and was checking out the menu, the prices are unbelievably high. Now I live in Los Angeles and prices are not even that high for pizza or pasta, unless it's a fancy restaurant. But even tho, it wasn't that expensive.
But if it's an expensive place it better be worth it. But nope!!
Ordered a pesto chicken fettuccine.
This pasta was drench in a watery pesto sauce.
It was basically like im eating fucking ramen noodles with green food coloring soup.
It had :
No Flavor
Not enough cheese
Pasta was hard
And there chicken was watery and felt expired!!!!!
I myself had to add allot of parmesan and chili peppers for it to taste better. But the watery sauce was taking out the flavor.
But no way I couldn't waste it. I finished my damn food ""ONLY CAUSE I DID NOT WANNA WASTE $20 ON A FUCKING PASTA !
WOW !!!!!! I don't know who your guys chef is but for damn sure I'd make it way better than that person.
The only good thing about this experience was the water I drank. Omfg!!!!!"
"Olympia Pizza and Spaghetti House III","https://www.yelp.com/biz/olympia-pizza-and-spaghetti-house-iii-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","James A.","I've never liked Greek pizza as much as Italian-style pizza, but I've still had it plenty of times and it's been fine. That said, this place's pizza was among the worst pizza I've EVER had. I'm including frozen pizza and elementary school lunch pizza. The cheese was like mayonnaise (or maybe alfredo sauce?) baked at a high enough heat to create a thin brown crust. I don't remember the crust or sauce -- maybe it was fine -- but the cheese was so bad I thought I was being pranked. Look at other people's pictures (accompanying good reviews)--the pizza looks nasty! They have a lot of good reviews so obviously some people are fans, but I honestly don't get it."
"Olympia Pizza and Spaghetti House III","https://www.yelp.com/biz/olympia-pizza-and-spaghetti-house-iii-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nathan H.","Pros: Opens at 11am on weekends for pizza and the day cook is ALWAYS on point, salads are fresh as well, bartender John with all the tattoos is super friendly and will make your experience memorable plus give a good rec for local ink artist. Go Saturday for lunch, and if u don't have a great time I will pay for dinner plus your tattoo.
Cons: Evening time is a whole different story but I believe it starts with the owner as she sets the tone. For reg customers she appears standoffish unless you are gay and she got out of her comfort zone to know you. She is your typical Seattle freeze Capital Hill style, exhausted,and needs to retire. She sets the tone for the rest of her staff, most of which leave for a better working environment. I'm not surprised. She can be friendly but only to large group$ but to the the rest you are scum. Again please see my comments about bartender John. As for the other bartenders particularly at night, some are socially awkward, just don't care, and others should focus on than their job instead of their hair, flirting with girls, and try to be cooler than you.
The quality of the food at night is rushed as well, attention to detail is lacking as well as pizzas ordered for here came in a box. Again see John in the afternoon.
Because the core issue lies with the owner she will NOT be the change you seek.

Prices are expectedly steep however I have been spoiled by the creativity of Seattle's wonderful restaurants and sometimes crave a bit more from Mioposto.

The staff were awesome. We had a table outside in the shade of sunbrellas. It was a beautiful PNW June day.
We shared the Ceci, calamari, and lunch with balsamic pizza and arugula salad. Every dish was spectacular. The Ceci was particularly fabulous, as was the puttanesca that came with the calimari. The bread was some of the best that I've had. I used to make Italian bread with a Sicilian family, and I loved your crust and the fluffy but substantially chewy interior.
My only suggestions are: 1) please share that Ceci recipe with me!!; and 2) I would lightly bread and fry the calamari and serve it with the puttanesca as a sauce/dip, along with an aioli.
Thank you for a memorable and sweet Sunday lunch."

I had gone to the location in Seattle previously and really liked thenpizza so I was excited when I found out that Mioposto had a location in the island too. The butternut squash pizza is my favorite. Crust is thin, flavorful and the combo of butternut squash and prosciutto is the perfect balance of salty and sweet.
The small downside is that one pizza isn't quite enough food for 2 people. So you should probably get an appetizer too. I believe they also charge for bread which is kind of a bummer. Nevertheless, these things aren't big detractors at all. This is still my go-to place for dinner on the island."

Pizzas are only $10, which is a great deal. I'm not usual a big pizza fan, but I can get on board with Tutta Bella because their pizzas are like what you find in Europe. If you're hungry, or with a hungry person, you should each get your own. If you just want a snack, you're fine to share. I love the white pizza. My husband was skeptical of it because he loves tomato sauce but once he tried some he basically ate it all. They also have gelato, which I am very interested in trying, I just haven't gotten around to it yet The service is great and it's on the charming Columbia City main strip.

The pizza is always very consistent. When I first tried Tutta Bella I was surprised that there was no pepperoni on the menu. But then I got a real education Nepolitan pizza and the making to those standards.
Very thin crust, perfectly chewy but not all doughy.
Not too heavy on the sauce but just the right amount, and just a hint of sweetness.
They have ready made choices or build your own. I like prosciutto and arugula with red sauce.
It takes less than 5 minutes for pizzas to cook in that super high heat. You don't have to wait very long to get a very delicious and filling pizza.
They have some delicious sides, salads, and a few other items such as gelato. All are good.
This place will make me come off of my low carb lifestyle if I were close enough to go there as I used to be up until a few years ago.
For those of you who love pizza, and can consume carbs, I highly recommend that you give to to Bella a chance. I would love to hear your comparison to other pizza places, especially any others certified Neopolitan."

The dough was underdone in the center, a few smears of red but no flavor of tomato sauce, very little cheese, the meat was dropped into 1 area the center and not evenly spread, the olives and artichoke pieces were too small to contribute any flavor. Safe to say the worst pizza I've had in a while. I had a chance to watch the kitchen crew make a few pizzas while I waited and there wasn't any pride in producing a quality product.

Thankfully, we now can use one full hand to count the number of restaurants we would send foodie friends to on ""this side""!
Sogno di Vino was a real treat.
A warm and comfortable, if a bit snug, space abuzz yet quiet enough to hold a conversation.
The service was very good, prompt without doting. The only knock here was pacing. We were asked if we wanted to include our entree order when we ordered starters and regretted when we gave our pleasant server both. The main courses were brought while we still had not finished our starters and cocktails. A perhaps easy fix on our part, to wait and order mains but...
And said cocktails were generous and very well made, as was the Bruschetta starter. Four warm, grilled pieces of rustic bread topped with surprisingly flavorful tomatoes (it IS November!) deftly seasoned with oil and balsamic. A very substantial serving.
As were the mains. My bride was happy with her Chicken Marsala, and I very much enjoyed one of the evening's specials, a huge bowl of five large Lamb Meatballs, properly seasoned served over spaghetti with a creamy, delicious Bolognese, a generous dollop of what tasted of fresh, lovely pesto and a snowy dusting of parmesan. Both dishes were large enough to allow for a memorable Sunday lunch the next day. We could feel and taste the passion and honesty in their food.
The wine program is interesting. Attached to the dining room is a small tasting/retail shop, which had a thoughtful & eclectic variety of Italian & Washington wines. I didn't cross reference, but it didn't feel as though every wine in the shop was available on the short, but well-curated restaurant wine list. Our only criticism here would be to ask for a more generous by the glass selection.
We are pleased to be able to add the fifth restaurant to our intimate rota of excellent North Kitsap restaurants.
Molto Bene Sogno di Vino!"

OK, I know I can't give out Michelin Stars, but if I could, this place would be a contender! Comfortable & Relaxed setting. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive service. Elizabeth, our server, did a masterful job. We wanted to try everything, so we selected four ""Small Plates."" Elizabeth thought it would provide a notable introduction to the restaurant. Here's what we ordered:
Bruschetta Pomodoro: NEW TWIST - the Italian bread was fresh, tasty, and toasted perfectly, but, the fresh/ripe tomato, basil, olive oil, garlic, and balsamic reduction (nice touch) was served SEPARATELY! Daah, the bread doesn't get soggy - spoon it on as you wish, no hurry. Clever.
Prosciutto & Fig: Fresh, sweet figs with sliced aged prosciutto (yes, the prosciutto is normally sliced thinner, but the thicker cut added a different quality to the dish - interesting).
Crab & Corn Risotto Cakes: Another NEW TWIST - loaded with freshly cracked crab, but the cracked corn added a new, and welcomed, complexity. Clever.
Spinach & Gorgonzola: The gorgonzola was PERFECT and the spinach was fresh and cooked perfectly - ""fresh"" green color and no watery taste! I know it's more work, but stemless spinach is always welcome.
We shared a Caesar Salad with crisscrossed baby romaine lettuce. Superb Caesar Dressing. Would have loved an anchovy on the side.
DESSERTS: There's no way of explaining them. I don't think you'll find them anywhere else: Passion Fruit & Mango Tiramisu - Simply Insane. Lemon Verbena Goat Cheesecake - OMG!

I got the Chicken Piccata (close to $25, I could make myself with no issue for about $9 with organic chicken). The chicken was so dry and the sauce was mediocre. The bread pudding was for dessert and it was not bread pudding. Very dense, I wasn't executed properly. At the end of the night including two glasses of wine, I spent about $65 on a dinner for myself that I was very unhappy with."

The food was above and beyond. Also - I had a small issue with my pasta dish, and I'm super uncomfortable sending things back.

I don't come in very often, but I order from Uber eats all the time. The mushroom risotto, fried ravioli, and gnocchi are my faves."
"Veneto Italian Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/veneto-italian-restaurant-silverdale?osq=Italian+Food","Katarina W.","Went here for the first time and we tried the Risotto con Fungi, The Ravioli Fritta and the Gnocchi with Gorganzola sauce , we also tried the Chocolate flourless cake, the creme brulee and the cannolis.
The waitress that we had was.... okay. Not overtly friendly, no small talk, and took a long time for general service. She rarely smiled and almost seemed like she didn't care to be there, it's always pretty unsavory to me when you have someone working customer service that acts in such a way. I've managed multiple food establishments before and having employees that exude good customer service should be of the utmost importance.
Now, the food, the Gnocchi was good, not the best gnocchi we have had as it was a bit gummy, but it was good enough. The ravioli was good but how can you screw up fried ravioli. The Risotto was delicious, and I mean very very delicious. Great flavor! No regrets about ordering it.
The creme brulee was enjoyed greatly by my mother in law however I believed the flavor was a bit odd, mostly the consistency was kinda funky and it definitely was not the best creme brulee I've had before. The cannolis were pretty good, in fact it was nice to see that they truly were a sweetened ricotta filling whereas a lot of places around here almost taste more like a cream cheese frosting filling so this was pleasant to see they were more traditional. The chocolate flourless cake was a different texture than the average flourless cake but it was still good flavor, only wish that the piece was cut a little larger for the price.
Overall, the food was good, we would definitely be back for it again, service could use a remodel though ;)"

The hostess was courteous, prompt and accommodating. No issues with service. I ordered a house salad...salad would have been fine if it was not dressed at the restaurant. Generally in to-go orders the restaurants package the dressing separately so that the salad doesn't wilt into mush. The next dish was fried calamari. The calamari was over cooked, tasted like the product was purchased pre-made and fried in house. The sauce that was given with it reminded me of a tablespoon of marinara in a cup of hot water. The spaghetti Bolognese was greasy, as if the noodles were coated in butter or oil, and a few measly bits of meat clung to the noodles, no ragu to really speak of. A copious amount of unidentifiable cheese was melted on top. The tortellini in a Parmesan cream sauce (because let's be real, that was not Alfredo) was somehow both chewy and mushy, as well as bland. There were a couple of items that came with the meal. The bad: Stale bread with a dipping sauce. The good (and overwhelmingly best part of the meal): Andes Mints. There was a sign in the window that said they were hiring waitstaff, but I would strongly recommend hiring a new executive chef."

It's our favorite restaurant on the north side of Seattle. The decor is okay enough, nothing too special, the lighting is a bit bright (like I wish they had candles on the tables) but my goodness, the food. It's sooo good.
Also, I love that it's a family-owned place. It's Greek and the family is Greek. An ethnic restaurant run by ethnic people (unless it's Mexican) isn't very common in upscale, vanilla Seattle. If you're lucky, you'll run into the grandma on Saturday nights serving tables. She's the sweetest. The whole family is. There have been times I've asked for a particular pasta with particular veggies and they make whatever I want.
We have three kids and they can accommodate a large family like ours and thank God, it's one of the few reasonably priced places in Seattle. It's not cheap but it's not overpriced. Because it's not overpriced, we go there probably every two weeks.

I came for dinner about a week ago and it was basic and mediocre. I ordered pasta because it looked like that's what the whole restaurant was ordering, so I figured it must be good. I ended up with mushy overcooked pasta and overcooked shrimp. The pesto sauce wasn't special either. It's possible that it might have come from a jar?
They were very busy so perhaps the kitchen was slammed and that's why the food wasn't cooked properly? Perhaps this is also the reason why service wasn't great. It took a long time for anyone to approach us at the table, and when they finally did it was very ""what are you getting?"" instead of ""Hi, welcome, have you dined with us before?"" The rest of dinner was the same short cold service. It felt like they just wanted us gone to open the table for someone else.
I'm quite disappointed because I had such high hopes. It always seems packed with people and the Yelp ratings were so high that I thought it would be fantastic, except it wasn't. Nothing special about this place."

I was able to get a table without a reservation which was nice - but quickly came for realize (at least for my first visit) you have to wait 5-10 minutes to get initial drink service. I was by myself at a table below the bar area at this point, waiting for my friend.
When the server did come to my table, she was off putting. Friendly words yet came across as somewhat rude and condescending.
When my friend arrived it took the server a while for her to come to the table and get his order. When she did, he didn't get the most positIve vibe either. He ordered the same drink as I and was disappointed by the value for the price.
The server came to ask if we wanted food and we held off for a moment, debating if we wanted to stay for another drink - and for food. When we decided to ask for the check, it was evident she was annoyed by us. We saw her walk back toward the kitchen and say something to her colleague whom seemed to smile about whatever she said. We are pretty certain she spoke negatively about us at this point when we didn't ever do or say anything to her to warrant it.
I was hoping I would love this place, but nope! Not based on the service today.

- Carrots were overcooked, undersalted, and the sauce was both too oily and too thin
- ""Improved Whisky Cocktail"" was way too heavy on the absinthe
- Sous vide pork tenderloin toppings were not well balanced in proportion, and the pork was surprisingly tough for a supposed 5 hour cook.

Staff: friendly and attentive.
Ambiance: love it! It has a very industrial feel but it's bright and open. It's a small restaurant but the design makes it look like it's a lot more spacious. I even found the bathroom well designed. Also love an open kitchen.
Price: HH prices are decent for the portion and quality of food.
Food: ordered the oysters, pasta and burger. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The pasta and burger were both good BUT waaaaaaay too salty. The beef from the burger was one of the best I've had in a while. It comes with cheese which may be why it was salty. In that case, there should be less salt in the beef. The pasta also came with delicious Parmesan (?) but again, so salty. Thinking about it, I should have sent them both back.
I'm on the fence of going back. There aren't a lot of places like this in West Seattle. I may ask friends if they experienced the same overly salty dish or if it was just a fluke that day."

Standouts include: the burrata (which we've had served with both peach and eggplant, the grilled broccoli with fonduta, and the roasted baby carrots. The proteins are definitely the stars of the show, and I will have a hard time not ordering the pork collar and the NY steak on future visits. Both dishes have so much flavor, and the meat is cooked absolutely perfectly. I am usually not a huge fan of fries with steak, but these are crispy, salty, and delicious.

We had the oysters, fried tomatillos, pickles, and king crab corndog to start. The oysters and tomatillos were fantastic, but the corndog was out of this world. I will come back just for that corndog. I cant even describe how much joy you get with every bite. We went with the crab spaghetti and the roast duck as our mains, and they were equally delightful. Everything we had was simple, but done really well, which can be hard to do.
We finished off with some champagne and the olive oil brownie, a must have if you've got a sweet tooth or are a fan of crackerjacks (they make their own and sprinkle it on top and its rad).
Our waitress was super attentive and gave us some great recommendations, and definitely made the experience 10/10.

Just FYI if you have kids, they don't have high-chairs but was able to snag a booth which worked ok for the kid. I would say their brunch menu is made up of 25% breakfast and 75% lunch so if you want breakfast food, you might not be satisfied here. Also, prices are pretty high considering most items don't come with hash browns, eggs, etc.... and for the French toast it's literally a huge chunk of bread, while delicious was $15 with just topping and syrup (some fruit would of been nice). I got the eggs benedict and it was delicious and welcomed the side salad but again, I can see some people wanting ""breakfast"" food.
Service was ok, I was waiting for my friend to show up and got seated early but would of been nice to have been brought water or asked if I wanted anything to drink (really needed coffee) and waited about 10 minutes until I was acknowledged."
"Eight Row","https://www.yelp.com/biz/eight-row-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Molly I.","Wandered down here on a Sunday evening with a good friend.
Food was delicious. As a vegetarian, they had a decent offering - which I always appreciate. We ordered an Endive and Pear Salad (they happily swapped the dressing here since the one it came with had anchovies in it), and some Pumpkin Gnocchi. I asked the waitress if it would be enough, since it seemed a small-plate situation, and she suggested we order another item, so we went for the Roasted Broccoli. Everything we ate was delicious. The Gnocchi was light and tender, the broccoli zingy in the best way, and the salad refreshing. But two plates would have been plenty.
We decided to celebrate with dessert - an Olive Oil Brownie that was executed wonderfully.
Really the ONLY thing keeping this place from 5 stars was the incessant high pitched ringing that is apparently a result of them having the heater and the music on at the same time ... That was just horrific. Almost had us out of our minds. If I'd been there with my husband, rather than friend, I know he would've have been able to stand it and we would have had to leave.... So go on a warm day, when the heater isn't necessary. At least until they get that resolved."

It's a tiny shop and I spent much of my time there standing around, wondering if the other people in there had already ordered or if there was a line. It turned out that I was the only person who hadn't ordered yet, but both employees were working on the line, putting together orders. When I did place my order, I wasn't given a number (the five or so people in front of me hadn't gotten one either) so when the lady called out a number and order, we had no idea whose order it was. We just tried to guess based on who got there when. It seems like there could be a better system in place so there isn't any confusion.
I have to agree with another reviewer that my sandwich was... fine. The bread was fresh, but the sauce was underspiced, and the meatballs, while tender, were bland and nothing really special.
Lunch in this neighborhood is usually about $10-12 and that's about what I paid today.

Maybe because I grew up and worked in a sub sandwich shop for 7 years (albeit, a franchise and now almost completely dead one), but I'll say this place probably has the most disappointing subs I can imagine. Bread is toasted, but tough'ish/cold'ish. And the sauces and meats are... subpar taste and quality-wise. The food just doesn't taste fresh for whatever reason (yes, I ate it on the spot both times!). I'm sorry to disagree with many of the raving reviews, but it just doesn't come anywhere close to its 4* rating."

Suffice to say, the chicken parm did NOT disappoint. Easily one of the better chicken parms I've had, and I'm including all the ones I've had back from my years living in Boston. The chicken is perfectly fried, the sauce and cheese ratios are on point, and the sub roll is lightly toasted (that last piece is of particular importance to me).
I've since gone back to try the Italian sandwich, as well as the Meatball sub. Both were good, but not great--I've definitely had better back east--but still tasty sandwiches nonetheless.
I still need to try the brisket, which is next on the list for me. But that chicken parm will be hard to not order next time I go in!"

This doorman asked us for ID's at the entrance which we found odd cause this is a restaurant bar i.e. some folks are getting food some are getting drinks so don't ask for my ID if I'm not ordering alcohol. Curiously, the people who were right behind us weren't asked to provide ID's. My gf had an interim ID (she lost the real one) which is by all means legitimate. She also had a photograph of her passport just in case so we showed that. The guy was extremely rude about her not having a 'real' ID and made it seem like he was doing us a royal favor by letting us in.

The we had the meatballs, which came slightly after the salad so they got cold a bit and where not very good, they were mostly lacking sauce. The deluxe cheese bread was our favorite, and that was good.
The service was pretty bad, things came all at once, the server threw the stuff in our table. They wanted us out as quick as possible to sit the next people, and our water was never refilled.

If your credit card machine is down, you should let people know when they come in. Writing all the credit cards and CVV numbers in a notebook and asking customers to sign it, is not OK.

I'm a little picky about how sweet desserts are and usually shy away from cannolis because they always feel like a mouthful of sugar, but these were just the right amount of sweet and crunchy! There's a menu of 5-6 different types and I scooped up the Original, Espresso, and Lemon. They're made to order, too, so the shells are fresh, the filling is a really lovely smooth consistency and (again) not overpoweringly sweet. The lemon was my fav hands down, and it wasn't a long wait for 3 large cannolis at all. Service was fast, efficient, and polite! Pricing is a little on the expensive side in my opinion but, hey, it's a solid cannoli!

These are items that I have ordered hundreds of times across the US throughout my years of business travels and this was by far the worst pizza and wings I have ever eaten. The hot wings were burnt and so dry that I could only compare them to what I would guess dog food to taste like. As for the BBQ pizza, it felt and tasted like a mash of non-identifiable ingredients with a sickly sweet after taste. Obviously, others have had good experiences with this restaurant based on their other reviews which is why I ordered from them but I cannot imagine those positive reviewers received the same items that I did, made the same way. Saying all that, I don't want to discourage you the reader from trying this place if you are really interested in checking it out but maybe just avoid the wings and bbq pizza"

It's pretty standard for a salad (ask for olives if you are feeling up for it), but come here enough and you won't be able to get enough of it. Portions are good enough to take a portion home the next day. Entrée wise can't really go wrong with any of the pastas, the calzones fill you up and this pizza hits the spot.

I had made a reservation and the table was ready for us when we got there. The restaurant was fairly full so I was happy to see the reserved sign on our table. We were greeted, given water and really yummy focaccia bread. I ordered a couple appetizers and a beverage right away as I was about to eat off my arm. The burrata caprese salad was delicious, mostly cheese and lovely cherry tomatoes with a pesto drizzle. The artichoke hearts were a little disappointing. I didn't realize they came deep fried and breaded. Maybe I should have read the menu better. For dinner we order a special, butternut squash ravioli and pasta with clams. I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she said the manicotti was delicious. I took her recommendation only to have her come back 5-10 mins later to tell me they were out of manicotti. She didn't bring a menu and so I asked for a vegetarian recommendation - preferably something with lots of veggies. She offered the homemade spaghetti with marina. We also ordered a very delicious bottle of Shiraz that she recommended. My pasta was okay but didn't feel like a special night out dinner. I didn't try the clams, but did taste the pasta and there was zero flavor. I was shocked. I assumed the pasta would be in a butter clam sauce - no, tasted like unsalted tasteless pasta. There did seem to be an adequate amount of clams in the shell in the dish. The butternut squash ravioli was definitely the shining star of the night. Homemade ravioli, creamy squash filling with plenty on toasted cheese on top. Overall a nice dinner but not mind blowing.

Last night was so delicious, we are committed to coming more often. We started with the artichoke hearts, that came with a lemony-garlic aioli that was delicious and addictive. Then we had the beet salad - incredible delightful balance of sweet beets and pecans with the contrasting vinaigrette dressing - we LOVED it, ate every bit. Then I had the Osso Bucco, and my husband had the butternut squash lasagne. They were both divine -Osso Bucco so tender, and smothered in delicious root vegetables with an amazing sauce they were simmered in, all over a delightful potato cake. I was not prepared to like his butternut squash lasagne, and instead it knocked my socks off. The cheese combination with the squash and layers was unbelievable, so pleasing and inspired. The portions were generous however we couldn't stop, and ate it all. Which meant taking our delicious 1/2 order of focaccia home, and forfeiting the opportunity to sample their desserts. No matter -we'll be back! And sooner, next time. Go and enjoy, you won't be disappointed!"

Their sandwiches are made with the fresh bread and the meats freshly sliced/made in house. Of course the porchetta is delicious, but so is the meatball, and so is the pasta, and so is the salami. How I manage to choose, I don't even know! The prices run about $10-13ish and it is SO worth it.
The pricing for their sliced salami is a little cheaper here than at other stores. But the game changer is the amazing deal on their guanciale ($15/lb). I use that on every pasta sauce I make and the flavor is out of this world!!!"

After a year of knowing of this place's existence yet being unable to find a good reason to be in Pioneer Square on a weekday, I was finally able to sneak over now that they're open on Saturdays--and I was not disappointed!
Since I was with a few other friends, we ordered the meat, cheese, and olive platter (yum), the seasonal sandwich (potentially the best sandwich in Seattle), and a side of porchetta (can't miss). Everything was amazing. Even the Olive and Mole salumis, which, I'll admit, I had my doubts.
Next time I'll bring more people and go later in the day so that we can get our wine on--but if you're a fan of cured meats, porchetta, and, well, bring happy, then this is an excellent place to try. Highly recommend if you go with the right group.

The sandwich was massive! Like it was a good size portion for two people to split! So, in that sense, it was a solid price if you split it up. The bread was really good and fresh. The pork was flavorful and juicy.
I will say that I was expecting the crisp, crackling skin on the outside of typical Porchetta, so I was a tad disappointed. But that was just a small issue, I will definitely be back here if I'm ever in the area"

I ate my brother's leftover sandwich. I had the Porchetta sandwich and mine was a day old and had it in the fridge until it was my lunch time. I popped in the sandwich in the microwave for 2:30 and the bread was soft for me to eat. I was really impressed with the meat because it was still moist and it wasn't high in sodium (at least it didnt taste like that). The sandwich looks really plain, but it is still flavorful with herbs and loved the pickled jalapenos as it was a good touch. I'm giving 4 stars because I haven't actually gone there, but I would love to go there myself and try them fresh."

Service was decent, nobody checked in on me to see if my food was alright, but my food was fantastic so that didn't mean much.
The ambiance is nice, the booth was comfortable, and the oil served with the complimentary bread had some sort of pesto mixed into it which was absolutely delicious.

"Grazie Ristorante Italiano","https://www.yelp.com/biz/grazie-ristorante-italiano-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","J. R.","Dined here recently with a work group. We figured Italian would appeal to most tastes.
My critique is only on my food, since our group was large and I don't want to speak for anyone else there.
Overall rating? 2 stars. It was ok, but nothing to knock my socks off. On the level of a local version of Olive Garden perhaps?
Good menu selection and interesting sounding items. Service was very good considering our group size. Portions ok as was the temperature and time from order to service.
I ordered a luncheon special that had a cream sauce, sausage, mushrooms and I believe spinach. The ingredients sounded delicious. It arrived and was tasty. The pasta component was a bit too soft for me. I like it a bit more al dente.
Given our group, we all knew the 20% surcharge rule. I'm o.k. with that, and know going in. My biggest beef is that the 20% on my bill was computed on the total bill WITH sales tax.
If I'm not mistaken, I thought tips start with the food subtotal, not the total WITH sales tax. So, the tip base starts out larger when tax is included. Whether intentional or not, in my book it's not very transparent. You are automatically adding another 10% to the tipping base. Adds up over time.
Anyway, this is not one of my go-to places, having been here only once or twice before over the years. No big loss in my big dining picture. I have other favorites."

My brother got the lasagna and says it's the best he's had from a restaurant, and also liked the meatballs he got. My dad rates the chicken parm as a 1. I tried it and partially agree.

The step up coming from the nice live smooth jazz band playing on Saturdays and a pretty decent service. Otherwise, the menu and food quality is somewhat disappointing.
First, the bread served appears to be store bought and lacks flavor. There is nothing in it that draws me to take another piece. The soup selections are only two different types of bisques. I had the garlic soup which was tasty, but I would have preferred a more authentic Italian option. I am pretty big on soups after all. Lastly, I had the tagliatelle primavera for the main course which is a wood oven grilled vegetable garlic pasta. The dish was a bit overcooked and the char flavor was overpowering. This made it difficult to eat.
Overall, I gave the place a mixed rating. I may return to try other dishes, but this won't be my go to place."

Our server was super nice, helped us keep things sane with our small kids. Great ambiance, with a jazz trio playing in the bar. They have very thoughtfully laid out the restaurant into three distinct sections - the bar, restaurant area for couples and the family section kind of separated out. We really loved the woodwork in the ceiling.
The food was amazing as well. We started off with the bruschetta, the three spreads - tomato, ricotta, and olive were just out of this world. I'm not a big fan of olives but this tapenade was toast licking good. I had the filleto gorgonzola, which was done to perfection! The side of mashed potatoes and fried onions were surprising, I should've asked for some basic pasta instead. My wife went for the seafood fettuccine - great sauce, not so amazing seafood...but that's OK.

We sat at a table in the bar. We were there to hear a friend's band. A lot of jazz combos play here and we like to come here to support our friends who play here. There is no cover charge which is nice.
The first thing I noticed was how filthy the bar menu was. That immediately has me focusing on what else was wrong with the place, like the missing bulbs in the chandeliers and the way the copper colored table tops are no longer smooth.
Our server brings us dinner menus because we hadn't yet decided if we wanted a meal or snacks. Besides the bar menu being filthy none of the appetizer prices on the bar menu match the prices on the dinner menu. The bar menu has happy hour/non-happy hour pricing and the higher price on the bar menu is still lower than the price of the same appetizer on the dinner menu. I did not check our bill but for two appetizers, two beers and two cocktails, I expect we paid the higher of the three prices. I didn't see our server long enough to ask her and quite frankly the management should not have to leave it to the customer to figure it out.
We ordered the meatballs and artichoke dip appetizers. The meatballs came with what the menu called ""grilled polenta cakes"". The meatballs were lukewarm, not piping hot, they were okay and the polenta was two small triangles with black grill marks that looked more dirty than grilled and didn't taste like anything, yeah it's polenta. I am not certain what purpose they really served because they were small and there were three large meatballs. Was I supposed to eat them with bites of meatball or just dip them in the tomato sauce?
The artichoke crab dip was not my choice. It too was lukewarm, but what was really surprising, or maybe not, is that the kitchen is incapable of making toast successfully. Yep, they f***ed up TOAST!! It was two slices of dried out bread that wasn't toasted enough to support a dollop of the lukewarm crab dip! The dip was flavorless, no seasoning, and it really needs to go back to the decade it came from.
The cocktails I ordered were good, the bartender has a lot of regulars who know him by name but sometimes he talked so loudly he drowned out the combo.
We will likely be back to hear a friend's band but we're going to eat somewhere else."

I tried the burrata, risotto, and finished off with sorbet. All were really good and comforting. Great portion sizes too- it's rare to find something like this that tastes authentic but has a large enough serving size to need a box for leftovers.
The vibe of the restaurant is trendy yet inviting- I would be comfortable taking my parents there or bringing a first date. Gorgeous setting, friendly waitstaff, and a phenomenal wine list. Definitely worth a try on your next date night."

Overall - decent Italian food but definitely felt overpriced and very small portions. In order to leave full, be prepared to spend a lot.
The restaurant had a very Miami / Greece kinda vibe with people dressed to the nines and white walls, etc.

First, they don't have hardly any good decent price wine. Typically I can find a good bottle for $38-$42. Here the only red for under $50 is a Chianti so that was disappointing to start. For our food I got the arugula salad which was recommended by the waiter. It was just arugula and figs which would be great except there were only 3 TINY slices of fig. It was a really sad salad. My friend got the burrata and luckily she shared because it was fantastic and way better. I had the pappardelli and she had the cheese pizza. Both were wonderful. For dessert she had gelato and I had tiramisu, both great. I loved the vibe of the restaurant and the view. Didn't love my salad. Our waiter was okay, not too friendly.

Our waiter knew very little about wine, and actually mispronounced Sangiovese, calling it ""Sen-geo-vershee"". Fairly shocking for a nice Italian place, especially an Italian wine. He admitted later he didn't know much about wine. The Osso Bucco was a bit dry, and extremely under seasoned. We had to keep putting salt on it. Normally it's ""fall off the bone"" tender and in a flavorful gravy. Not in this case.
They charged us for an extra side without telling us, as well. Overall a disappointing experience. We won't be back."

For the first time, I wonder if we had a bad experience because of some systemic racism. The bartender wouldn't look my direction, was cold in every interaction, and took much longer to attend to us than any other table. The hostesses, despite many open tables throughout our meal, refused to move us to a table as they had reservations elsewhere.
When we placed our order, we noted we wanted to start with some risotto, meaning before the entrees. The bartender gave us a shrug and no apology when it arrived, cold, along with our lukewarm entrees that we ordered.
The food when cold was fine -- not worth giving this place a second chance though.
Note to the staff: an apology or warmth in experience can go a long way to earning customer patience."
"Italianissimo Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/italianissimo-ristorante-woodinville?osq=Italian+Food","Amie J.","Italianissimo has been one of my favorite go-to restaurants bringing family, friends and clients since 2000.
I will spend the significant money to relax and enjoy lovely food in a calm atmosphere.
Sadly, the last 2 visits at Italianissimo have been abysmal. Reviewing the online reviews, I noted there is an increasing amount of unhappy customers and there is no management response or apologies to these people.
Last night we arrived at our reservation time and was not greeted by the seemingly high schooler who was the ""host"". There was nothing professional in his appearance or actions as he scrambled for 15 minutes through the restaurant as we waited in the entrance.
We waited another 10 minutes at our table with no water, bread, drinks or attention.
Finally another seeming frantic high schooler/ young man arrived at the table to ask for our drink selection. I asked a question about one of the Italian wines and he did not know the answer.
He was gone for over 10 minutes when he arrived with my glass of wine, it had wine dripping all over it and no wine for my friend. We waited another 10 minutes for her wine to arrive.
We asked twice for Balsamic Vinegar for the cold bread that was unceremoniously plopped on a plate. This took 15 minutes.
It took another 15 minutes for my cup of the signature Shrimp Bisque to arrive and alike my visit from a month ago, it was a thin and quite lackluster facsimile of the typical delicious recipe.
We waited another 20 minutes for our main courses to arrive and mine arrived lukewarm. At the risk of waiting another long period to get it back, I simply gave up and ate a portion.
This young waiter was very nice but obviously poorly trained which is the fault of the management. He constantly apologizing but we were there to relax after a busy week. It was anything but relaxing and we ended up with a high bill. He charged us for an item that we did not get and he did not know how to take it off and there was no one to ask.
Again, Italianissimo has not trained their staff in good customer service.
In years past, they had superlative professional waiters and waitresses where we always felt like welcome guests. Without exception, we always had memorable, relaxing meals.
While I considered Italianissimo the ""crown jewel"" of Woodinville for almost 20 years, save your time, frustration and money until management decides to become a professional restaurant again."

It was a Saturday night, the six of us were driving by and decided to stop here based on the good reviews to grab some delicious food. When we entered and asked if we could have a table, instead of the hostess letting us know that she had no tables available for us for the rest of the night or what time she could sit us (even if it was not for hours), with attitude she replied ""No"".
We kind of just looked at her, and each other, in silence for a few heart beats thinking maybe she was just joking. Nope, after an abundant amount of awkward silence she started complaining about all of the groups she still needed to sit and that it's just not going to happen for us.
I totally understand that places get swamped on Saturday night, and I am ok to be told that I may have to wait 3 hours for a table. Not making reservations, that's on me. But there is no need to be rude."

Finally to just saying that we want to pay for pasta on the side and she finally said they can do it. To requesting for some bread ( took 2 times to ask for it and over 10 minutes). When asking for the 2nd time, this same server was abrasive and said ""You are not the only table"" and your table will receive bread when I get to it. The lack of customer service and kindness was disappointing. Bread finally came after 3rd ask and it was cold.
We asked to talk to manager and she goes to ""oh, you want to talk to the manager and smugly took me over to Sam who acted like he was wanting no part to address the issue of service. Sam made excuses that they had 2 eight tops and eventually he said that was his wife.

Whilst waiting, we observed her role her eyes multiple times when new parties arrived and others were complaining as to her attitude as well. Our waitress was polite, but not overly welcoming. Our drink from the bar (dirty martini) arrived watered down (which we assumed the bar tender left it in the ice too long). The waitress replaced it and apologized. Overall, the pizza was good, the waitress was good, but the overall experience was not one that will ever bring us back.

The full price pizza I got was Prosciutto which cost $17, it was barely 12"" maybe 11. Incredibly bland with little to no cheese and a very slim layer of 5 small pieces of prosciutto. I asked for extra sauce on the pizza, but it still came a bit dry so I asked for some on the side.
They charged me $1 for the sauce and $17 for a tiny mediocre pizza. I was amazed that they are in business. total or $24 for lunch and I was still hungry afterwards....:(

"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","RoseJean W.","Came here with my dad while he was visiting and initially I just thought it would be another artisan pizza place, but I was completely blown away. The pizza is just the way I like it, with a thin crust, but not so paper thin that it's a big cracker. Cocktails were spot on and the tiramisu was addictive. I got home and wished I had gotten some to go... still thinking about it weeks later.
But this review is more about the service, which I can confidently say was perfect. Josephine (blonde hair, early 20s), was one-hundred-percent accurate in anticipating our needs and offered us what we needed before we even knew we needed it. She was congenial and attentive without being over-the-top. As a veteran server, I realize how difficult this can be and her nuanced attentiveness deserves a tip-of-the-hat. In fact, both of the ladies on the floor that night were working in tandem, the energy was just right, and I was truly impressed. It's refreshing to see a newer spot have good food and amazing service. Looking forward to coming back for more of that killer tiramisu and ladies, keep crushing it. You're appreciated!!!"
"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Natasha H.","Not bad but wasn't anything special. I wouldn't recommend the Caesar salad, it was honestly one of my least favorite I've had in recent memory. Everything felt overpriced and then on top of that I was charged an extra $3 for ricotta on my pizza and it was just 3 small dollops. The crust was a little saltier than I prefer but the texture was great and the flavor of the toppings was wonderful. Overall, I didn't leave disappointed but probably won't be back."

"Cornuto Pizzeria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornuto-pizzeria-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sean T.","A solid Neapolitan pizza place that's become our staple on nights when we need something tasty, good for kids, and in our neighborhood (Greenwood). The place is small but rarely has a wait. There are 3 sections of the restaurant, a small part where you can view the pizza oven where all the action happens, a larger room where I have seen larger groups, and a back patio for when it's nice!
The menu has a revolving selection of cocktails and wines by the glass and bottle. The pizza menu is extensive and the apps/salad are legit. We typically get the meatballs, Caesar salad, margarita pizza, diavola, verde, and sometimes the Vongole (clams!). It's hard to go wrong.
The atmosphere is casual but as it gets later, it's a bit dim and the candles on the tables add a nice touch, so if you swing by after 8 it would be a good date place or if you come by later, say after 10pm, it would be nice for after a game or concert."
"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Liz S.","Arrived around 7 on a Tuesday and the place was full! Thankfully a high top table was available in the bar so I snagged that ASAP.
For drinks I went with their special grapefruit? Negroni ($12). It was lighter than a regular Negroni and pretty good. It was served in a lowball... up? I don't remember honestly it could have had ice ha. I had a sip of their regular Negroni ($11) as well--gin, Campari, vermouth--and was glad I went with the special. Well I had two of them and yes they're strong so drink your water and eat ha.
Now there aren't a lot of healthy/meatless options (especially plant-based) but thankfully the Barbabietola salad was sounding good. The salad is comprised of lots of fresh arugula, braised beets, fennel, goat cheese, and basil pesto dressing ($8/$12). I received a pile of lightly tossed arugula (yay for not dumping on the dressing) along with a handful of cubed red beets, fennel shavings, and a smattering of crumbled goat cheese. I had requested that the cheese be left off but they must have overlooked that note. Oh well, I'm not allergic so it didn't matter too much... cheese is tasty I just try to limit my intake. I somehow managed to refrain from chowing down on the bread that came out before dinner but I did polish off my salad.
The atmosphere is pleasant. Casual but not toooo casual. Service was decent, no real complaints.
It would be nice if they had another veggie option, maybe something without a ton of dairy but my experience was enjoyable enough."
"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Maria B.","Amaro was a pleasant surprise in Bothell. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. The customer service was fantastic.
Drinks: I had wine, which was recommended by the server and was a perfect accompaniment to the food. My friend had a cocktail and then wine, which he said was also paired well.
Food: I had the butternut squash ravioli, which was absolutely delicious. The portion size was just right for me and it was fantastic. My friend had one of the pizzas (pepperoni) and a side of crispy brussel sprouts, which he said was really good.
Overall, it was a great experience at Amaro and I would definitely recommend this place."

"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Kim K.","This Italian restaurant was recommended to my husband and I by our son. He was there the Friday before and had the lasagna and couldn't stop talking about it. We went there on Thursday, 1/30 to celebrate my husbands birthday. We went to the bar to have drink before our reservation. Met two different folks there and they both said they were regulars and said this place made the best Italian food in the area. The guy beside me had some cannelloni that looked amazing.
We get seated and was greeted by an amazing young man named Zack. I told him we were hungry and we already knew what we wanted. Lasagna and cannelloni. Well, he took a quick second to recommend a few of their other known favorites of the restaurant. So, my husband got the lasagna and I got the filet. Since the lasagna takes 20 minutes to cook, Zack suggested the Brussels sprouts. They were so tender yet had crispness to them.
Long story short, Zack was amazing and is one of the most engaging, energetic and kindest waiters we have had in a LONG time. Let's just say, if I had to choose my last meal, it would be a meal from Amaro Bistro and exactly what we had for dinner last night.
Oh yes, Zack gave us a complimentary Tiramisu for dessert and it was the BEST we have ever had.
KUDOS to the chef!"
"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Christine S.","It makes me so happy that Amaro is in Bothell, because the options for good date night places are pretty thin in the north end. We are here very frequently, and I think I have had everything on their pasta menu, plus some specials.
My husband adores the lasagne, and I also really like it which means something because I don't generally like lasagne at all. My standing favorites though are the canneloni, rigatoni bolognese, and the tortellini. Amaro does a red sauce very, very well.
They have a fantastic wine list (for glasses, the Merf Cab Sauv is unbeatable) and they give you complimentary bread with butter. I am always annoyed when restaurants give you olive oil with the bread, because the oil is such poor quality. To be fair, they do also have oil and vinegar for bread, but I skip it. Overall, I am happy to bring friends and family to Amaro for dinners out and will continue to be here every other weekend."
"Amaro Bistro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/amaro-bistro-bothell?osq=Italian+Food","Morgan P.","Amaro Bistro swept me off my feet.
Traveling from the tri-state area and growing up with authentic Italian food, I had my doubts trying Italian on the west coast. Before testing my luck, I started with the caprese amaro appetizer that was topped with the most delicious balsamic I've ever had. That's when my tastebuds started spiraling out of control! Every other item that I ordered from there on out was just as good as the last...the salmone..the pollo arrosto..I'm still drooling from it. I probably could have eaten the scraps out of the garbage and it would still be just as delicious.
You don't need to go into Seattle to find good food, take a break from the busy city and relax with a home-y ambiance filled with servers that know how to take care of you.
I can truly say that Amaro Bistro changed my views of west coast Italian."

I think we tried a lot of food here and I can confidently say almost everything taste great.
Our go to menu is, Bruschetta (so much diced tomato which we love and you can share with kids), Linguine di Mare (how can you be amazing every single time!), Carbonara (if you are a cream pasta person), and any kind of wood stone fired pizza (personally I like Margehrita).
They also have variety of kids menu and ours love Meatball Spaghetti (their default is Rigatoni but it's a bit chewy for our kid so he loves with the spaghetti noodle).
And the service is great. Very friendly and quick.
I guess the only downside is that it's slightly pricey but worth it. If you are a Microsoft employee, you get one entree free with one entree."

It tastes fresh, the ratios of everything were just right, and I crave this pizza often. I dont know the wait time for a single slice of pizza but we ordered a whole one and it took about 45mins, I think its worth the wait.

As for the customer service, the servers were nice and straight to the point. The environment is much bigger than I ever expected. I was reading the flyers around the place and I think they have entertainment nights of karaoke, live music, and etc. Its very cute.

If you think the price is steep, I promise these pizzas are enormous and there will be leftovers.
They are located in a bar, so it's not really a ""eat in with the family"" environment, but it's a nice little spot with some great street parking. Showing up a little early and having a quick cocktail is a bonus if you have the time.

Im a thin crust guy but this medium deep dish is so bomb. It isn't straight Chicago deep dish so it's not as filling. The crust is what sets it apart from the rest. Dubbed as Detroit style pizza, the crust is crispy burnt cheese. That's not all, it's topped with crispy pepperoni. So each bite is super flavorful, oily, crunchy and cheesy. I usually just sit there and would eat half the pie and contemplate if I want to eat the whole thing.
This place is tucked away in the back of the lockout lounge on Beacon. Order in advance and you can just pick it up. They even deliver. Since I live so close, this was my go to pizza spot."

We came on a busy Saturday afternoon, and unlike Sam's we were greeted upon arrival. The attentive service continued throughout our time there despite them being fully packed - including the outdoor patio (it was sunny the last time we visited). Overall it was an open, welcoming atmosphere where they even display many of their kegs through glass above the TV's, which is a nice touch. Speaking of TV's, they had many of them throughout the restaurant, but they were high enough to not be overwhelming. They also played music instead of the TV audio, so the verdict is still out as to whether or not it would be a good place to catch a Hawks game.
The food is consistent and very good. And the guacamole was better than most Mexican restaurants in the area with big, fresh chucks of avocado throughout. They have a great selection of food, and an even better drink selection - including shots of Rose, which my wife appreciated!
The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because while they advertise happy hour every day on their signs outside, our bill did not reflect the happy hour price for any of the happy hour items we ordered (hint: the guac is on happy hour). I'm guessing it was either a mistake on our bartenders part, or they recently changed their happy hour rules without updating their signage."

I've gotten almost everything on the menu -- and it is all superb.
A particular compliment goes to their lasagna: it is a family recipe, and they have spices in there that so beautifully go together, you will truly feel like you are just happy and warm all over! My family has Sunday night dinners, but on the days that my parents have swanned off somewhere for vacation, I go here and get lasagna, and I am happy I haven't been deprived of a home-cooked meal :)
Thanks, Sopranos!!"

I am 2 months into a streak of eating out every day worth over a month left to go due to kitchen repairs from flooding. Food has lost its joy. Every meal feels the same now.
But I just had Sebi's Bistro delivered to my house and I am in AWE. I woke from a nap after a stressful day of work and an oncoming migraine to a delivery of perogi - half meat, half potato. The meat were good, the borsht was good, but the potato? Honestly, they're on my top 10 foods I've ordered during this whole fiasco. They are fluffy and creamy and tangy and comforting and nothing I could say here would sing their praises high enough.
I cannot wait to try the rest of their menu and to get these perogi fresh in their restaurant. I'm in love."

Borscht: sweet and clean-tasting, felt healthy and made my tummy feel good. Been dreaming of it ever since.
Fried pierogis: YUM! Came with sour cream and sauerkraut on the side. I was sad when the server took away the plate that still had a glob of sour cream on it, but I didn't want him to think I was a pig, so I didn't say anything. We ate them as an appetizer, but next time I might get as the main.
Cabbage rolls: a delicate, melting layer of cabbage gently enfolds a mound of fragrant rice and ground meat. The whole thing is smothered in a creamy, tangy tomato sauce.
Blueberry dumplings: basically a blueberry pierogi. Pushing the carbs, but they were delicious, so who cares? I liked that they weren't super sweet.
For the amount of food we consumed, I found the bill to be quite reasonable. Elegant ambiance, with white tablecloths. I am going back and bringing my mother for her birthday dinner next week."

The Caesar salad had nice crisp romaine lettuce. The dressing was light and tasty. I think they were rationing the Parmesan cheese. I would have liked more than a couple slivers.
Ending on a more positive note...the hand cut fries were delicious and perfectly seasoned. The baguette with butter was good, like it ought to be. It was fresh, crunchy and chewy and would have been lovely if I could have swapped it 'buttered and toasted' french dip sandwich bread."

"Cafe da Pino","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-da-pino-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Stephen N.","This is the favorite go to place for my family and me in Seattle. We love the personal attention, we love the food, we love the intimate setting, and we love the atmosphere. The setting is small, intimate and casual. It's like being invited into Pino's house, sitting down, and being served a meal.
On occasion, some of us have spent up to four hours at Pino's, chatting and talking with the Pino regulars who stop by regularly and are like extended family. Pino periodically comes by and sees how things are going, brings out more food, and when the bottle is empty opens another bottle of wine or refreshes the water pitcher.
If you crave luxurious atmosphere, fawning wait-staff, and full-blown menus, this isn't your place. If you want to feel as if you stopped by to visit friends and family in a small southern Italian villa, this should be your spot. To appreciate Cafe da Pino, don't go to get a meal. Go to become part of a family. Because at its best, Cafe da Pino isn't about food; it's about relationship, with food and wine as the lubricant."

An important change - the restaurant is now open for dinner by reservation only. Pino cooks for your reservation, and that is all he prepares. If you walk up, expecting to be seated, you probably won't be. (That happened to one group while we were there.)
If you have some food preferences or restrictions, that needs to be conveyed when you make your reservation."

We didn't notice he was actually closed but when we came in he said I'm making sausage, give me 10 minutes. So we waited for him to finish.
He recommended some wine for us and as we got ready to order he asked us if we wanted to order or wanted him to take care of us. We told him please take care of us. When a chef asks that should be the only answer. :)
He served us a couple plates of his house cured meats and homemade cheese. The entree was a bolognese on penne. It was very good. Don't expect this food to be highly spiced with garlic and Italian seasonings. One thing I discovered when travelling through Italy is most of the food doesn't come garlicy or heavily spiced. This tasted authentic.
As we ate some of 'the guys' came by for dinner which made the ambiance friendly and welcoming. We knew we were experiencing something special... which we knew to these guys was 'just Wednesday'.
Dessert was the lemon cake which was made by one of 'the guys'. It was light and not overly sweet and very delicious.
Pino offered some of his lemoncello which was creamy and smooth and we happily killed the bottle for him.
The tab for all that food was reasonable for 4 people: 2 bottles of wine, 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, 2 pieces of cake and about 5 shots of lemoncello came to about $200.
He also will do special woodfired pizza parties. He doesn't use email. He said he uses smoke signals. You have to go in person to arrange anything special.
Pino may come off as a bit rough around the edges but he's very warm and loves cooking for people."

I got the tortellini with marinara sauce, and she got the ravioli with cream sauce, peas and prosciutto. The marinara sauce tasted like it was from a jar and the pasta could have been from a Buitoni package. The ""prosciutto"" was flavorless and thick- we think it may have been ham or Canadian bacon. The parmesan was not fresh; it was, no joke, from a Kraft canister. The bread was dry and the service bland. To top it off, the portions are small and the prices high.

Honestly, this is a constant go-to spot in downtown Kirkland I often frequent. I have been here multiple times to celebrate birthdays, work promotions, and so much more...

I gave this place a 2-star review only because of the manager. If I rated on food only, this would be a 4-star review. The pasta is pretty good and most things I have had here are worth the trip.

I was given a warning there was no more space for any additions after these few were added. I understood. When I arrived, someone had brought their significant other (out of my control) and was berated that I was pre-warned about bringing anybody else. I literally thought I was getting a lecture from my mother. We politely explained we are a loving group and are okay squeezing an extra person in. Since the restaurant was packed, I overlooked this thinking it was a one-time thing. Then, I came in recently to have some food and drinks at the bar, something casual. The restaurant was slow and not even half full. When we came in the manager asked: ""Do you have reservations,"" as we walked to the bar. ""No, we are meeting a friend at the bar."" The manager looked confused and concerned and swiftly went to the bartender to ask if it she was okay serving us without reservations. We later double checked if you need reservations to simply sit at the bar, and the answer was of course, NO. The way she handled the situation seemed as if she was bothered by our presence and we did not feel welcomed, even to the point where I did not want to order food. I was talked into staying and after a ~$200 meal it was time to leave. I left with my partner and we received a sly smile as we walked out - almost like she was thankfully we were leaving. Of course, my friend was right behind us and she received a warm and thoughtful salutation.
After we left, I received multiple questions on the way the manager treated us and why we were singled out. For that I am not sure, I am not one to jump to conclusions, but even someone in our party asked if she was prejudice (since everyone else was treated with respect). I am not one to leave negative reviews, but I can think of no other alternative to express my concern and disinterest in the place that I once valued."

"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Trang P.","This place is decent. Aside from their cool location (inside of the Amazon Sphere), their menu wasn't super expansive and their HH is just okay. HH was 1/2 off on 4 appetizers and $15 for the pepperoni pizza. It's also a bit more on the pricey side and for the food they served - it wasn't entirely worth it.
Not to mention, our waiter wasn't very attentive. We had to ask him for a refill on water and crostini a couple of times before he remembered. He also forgot to ring in the focaccia bread so when we got our burrata, we didn't get a chance to eat it with the bread. He also cleared our calamari without asking if we were done with it and did not pick up our dirty plates. The host was much friendlier and attentive IMO.
Also note there is a 20% gratuity charge and the gratuity charge is added to the total... so they TAX you more off your total bill. I have never experienced the gratuity charge being a part of the total at any other establishment.. so this was indeed strange. Personally - I would have not mind paying the 20% gratuity if A) service was better B) the food was better.
My friends and I ordered a wide selection of food - focaccia, burrata, chicken liver pate, gnocchi fritti, calamari, scallop crudo, penn cove mussels, Salish Sea halibut, the Lumni Island flash fried shrimp, and the pepperoni pizza.
What I liked:
Pepperoni pizza, focaccia, burrata (although nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary), squid, scallop crudo, and the Salish Sea halibut.
Everything else was just sub par. The gnocchi in particular was a complete waste of money. It was just overly salty, lacked flavor and was dumped in Parmesan.
Most likely will not be making a return."
"Willmott’s Ghost","https://www.yelp.com/biz/willmotts-ghost-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Derek B.","I'm giving this 5 stars because of the pepperoni pizza + decor. It's in the Spheres so that's a thing. The decor is magazine-worthy, and you can get some good IG moments here. You can make reservations on OpenTable, so that's convenient. So yeah. That's enough for 5 stars.
The people who work here are, like, *cool*. But to the guy's credit, we asked for wine recommendations to pair with the pizza, and he was knowledgable about their wines and gave a great recommendation.
We ordered burrata and focaccia to start. After a few moments the guy came back saying that they were out of burrata. We got there right when they opened. So that was whatever. We still got the focaccia and it was good. And with the burrata, I'm pretty sure it would have been amazing.
The pizza was perfection. I think it's called Sicilian style? The pepperoni was on point. So so good. They serve it traditionally where it isn't cut. And they give you scissors to cut it. So if you're trying to look cute on a date or something, be prepared to deal with that.
We ordered the pistachio ice cream with biscotti even though we were pretty full, and it was definitely not a mistake.
I'll definitely be back."

I knew when I booked that the restaurant was expensive and I have no issue paying for great food and have all over the world. This restaurant just did not live up to great...barely even good. I found the food unremarkable. So much that I said something to the server who then brought the manager over. The manager comped us one meal because it seemed ridiculous to pay $500 for two people to have a meh meal. I can't even remember anything that we even ordered or ate, it was that boring and blah. Even so the best part of this restaurant is the actual space and view itself.
Do not come here for fine food and even for fine service. If you feel compelled, just come for a drink. Sit at the bar. Spend $30 or so and then leave.
Totally not worth the money and time."

I visited for the tasting menu, and was severely underwhelmed by its lack of creativity and depth of flavor. Bland carrots passed for a full course. Well executed meat was a later addition. There was nothing that made me want to eat it again.
Yes, it's a Seattle mainstay, yes it has an amazing atmosphere, yes the wine is good, and yes the service is impeccable. But, if you are truly looking for a thought provoking fine dining experience, you are better off looking elsewhere. If you want a completely inoffensive and uncreative meal in a nice space, then I suppose Canlis is a good option"

This time, the food was mediocre and the service was really weird. I was eating (was literally scooping up food with my fork to eat off of a half full plate) and someone came and asked me directly if they wanted to clear my plate. ?????? That's like basic, not to ask someone eating if they want their plate cleared. Our server was nice but popped in to ask if the food temperature was good. . we all thought that was an odd question to ask instead of asking if the food was good.
The amuse-bouche (rolled up pancake with matcha powder) was really hard and weird. The chawanmushi was really really smokey, which you wouldn't get from the menu. The souffle was good, but the last few pieces of small bite desserts were. . very underwhelming. One of the bites were so bad the whole table (except for one) of 5 agreed that it tasted burnt and awful.
If you are looking for a good dining experience in Seattle, skip Canlis and go to Altura or Tarsan I Jane. More variety and actual good food and service."

"Calabria","https://www.yelp.com/biz/calabria-bothell-2?osq=Italian+Food","Rio D.","I give 5 star to this restaurant for the following reasons:
- Friendly service
nice and professional server.
- Good food
Ok, I've gone there many times to make a comment about their food. Their Calabria sauce based penne, Parmesan Chicken, and tiramisu are FANTASTIC !!!
Because of my background, I'm attuned to authentic Italian cuisine, but regardless, they are some really solid and outstanding flavors on their own.
I also think there are a bunch that are great but not orgasmic but hey, that's pretty awesome! Why? Appetizers, salads, soups, pasta, meat dishes are covered then!
If there was a way to rate 4.5, that would have been my choice at the moment and here is why:
- Pricing
I mean, I get it, Seattle's COLA is rising and I see pricing points all going up in pretty much anywhere, and this is a nice little restaurant. And the volume of their food is generous enough so it's justifiable. But it's located in Everett/Mill Creek area and more of my wishful thinking that they are either a bit more economical or surprising in volume to differentiate them from others. (I do admit that I appreciate their free endless bread service )
- Fish meals
In my opinion, they can give more kicks and deeper flavors to their fish dishes. Right now, I don't find their current fish dishes attractive enough to order again. But again, other than other than fish, pretty awesome! I hope they can improve because I do love fish!"

I really had high hopes for Serious Pie, but the texture and flavor are off. The crust isn't quite chewy enough, and is often gritty throughout, instead of from a light cornmeal or semolina dusting on the bottom only. I don't like the salt sprinkled on the bread and toppings: it should be integrated into the components evenly. SP is among the better options in Seattle if you want pizza, but doesn't compare to an NYC pie."

As we get seated the server didn't look like he knew what he was doing, never got our breadsticks with our salad, never checked on us, our water was empty and never bothered to come by and check if we needed more water. We would ask for more bread and salad and it didn't come until we were done with all our food. We didn't even enjoy the food because of how bad the service was, very disappointed. Because the server was taking forever we just payed with the little computer that's on the table and left without hesitation."

I saw a TV ad for $10.99 ""Oven Baked Pastas"" at Olive Garden, so we went there. We both ordered an oven baked pasta dinner, even though we didn't see the special listed on the menu - but, I trusted the TV ad. The bill came with the full price of $21.99 each. Neither the waitress nor the manager heard of the ""special"" or knew anything about it. The manager acquiesced, discounting the price to $19.99 each, when I showed him that was their normal price listed on their web site. The food and service were great, but I was embarrassed and disappointed because I tried to take it easy on my friend's generosity."

First let me say the Host stand is staffed by mean girls. Little eye contact and kinda rude. And the ladies room was really neglected. When I mentioned it I got a canned response that made me think they hear this way too often. I should have left.
My waitress was fine if hurried, but my requests misfired. My martini with no vermouth was pretty watery and did have vermouth. I drank it as she seemed stressed. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana with angel hair rather than spaghetti and asked for very little salad. I think she tried to make a small salad but it was still too much. As for my entree: spaghetti all the way.
Beyond that, I should also remember that good Italian food is not likely there. Greasy and bland at the same time. I need some sort of a taser that stops me when about once a year I think to try try again."

Many businesses do a nice Veterans Day special or discount for active military and retired. Olive Garden offers a free meal off a special menu with a pretty nice selection. The husband apparently has better foresight than Professor Trelawney from HP and anticipated there might be a wait. He easily made reservations online and despite the hangry mob in the waiting room, we were seated upon arrival.
Our server was pleasant and attentive. They brought out the usual salad and kept off the croutons for me since I'm a no choice allergy member of the glutenisgross club. If an Olive Garden salad is something new to you, well then, the dressing is about its only redeeming quality and helps make the iceberg lettuce palatable. Their gf menu includes a gf pasta prepared in separate water and choice of marinara or meat sauce. There's not a lot of selection so I always go with the same meat sauce every time I find myself in an Olive Garden. It's mediocre but I definitely appreciate having a pasta option. The husband decided his free meal would be the chicken parm and overall found it to be nice and crispy and well prepared, but again there's just a mediocrity to this chain's sauces.
Our noms came out quickly despite it being a Sunday night and we were in and out in under an hour. I appreciated the kitchen's effort to keep me away from the glutens and we had a great server. We also always appreciate acknowledgment of our veterans and active duty military. Overall a solid Olive Garden location."

"Little Lago","https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-lago-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Gypsy G.","I've tried a lot of pizzas in this town, and Little Lago has one of the best. Our favorite is the Salsiccia Pepperoni - great sauce, crispy crust, and a sweet and (lightly) spicy flavor. I wish I could comment on the other menu items, but we are kind of addicted to the Salsiccia at the moment. A pizza per person typically feeds us.
Customer service is always quick and friendly.
I only wish that the restaurant/cafe portion was just a bit bigger, as half of the space is allocated to groceries. Some context on this: The neighborhood would not let any businesses operate a full fledged restaurant/cafe here, so hence the poor use of space. On the upside, it's fun to peruse the shelves while you wait for your order. Makes you feel like you're overseas, looking at specialty groceries, where the price is not a concern because you don't feel like doing the exchange rate conversion in your head. It's a sweet little neighborhood cafe."

You can pick up the best roasted chicken you'll ever eat, perfectly cooked flatbread pizza (mushroom and fontina is my favorite) and sandwiches, salads, fresh baked pastries and muffins etc. The owner, Carla also owns the restaurant Cafe Lago on 24th Ave E in Montlake.

The menu is very limited and so is the street parking around the restaurant. Surprised there is no parking lot or valet. Overall, prices were on a higher side for what you get. The atmosphere is cozy like a neighborhood restaurant.
As for the food, it was fine but not spectacular. The arugula salad with pistachio vinaigrette was good but not worthy of the price given it was literally just arugula and dressing with a few pieces of dried fruit on top. Brussel sprouts were okay but could've used a hint of salt, but the waitress wasn't around at the time so I could ask - although I will say that the service overall was fine. My main dish was the salmon which was the fish of the day. I was surprised how perfectly this was cooked. Definitely the star of the show. I also tried the sausage pasta dish and was underwhelmed. For an Italian restaurant that supposedly makes their pasta in house daily, I found the dish fairly mediocre.
I toyed between three and four stars but ultimately gave it four stars because there was a cute hostess that also helped serve us. While she wasn't our main waitress, I wish that she was because she was very friendly and cute, she had a great energy to her. Having energetic, friendly, attractive, happy service staff is huge and I feel like this is undervalued by a lot of restaurants these days, but definitely shouldn't be overlooked.

"Cantinetta Bellevue","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantinetta-bellevue-bellevue?osq=Italian+Food","c c.","I gave this place another try after an underwhelming experience several years ago. I was hoping that the passage of time, more experience and a new set of staff members would bring this place to a different level -- but Cantinetta continues to be mediocre.
The restaurant lured me back with the cozy vibe that it gave off from the outside looking in. The dim lights and candles made me hope for a nice local neighborhood Italian place that we could frequent. But in reality, the dimness makes it hard to see the food right in front of you, and perhaps that was intentional.
The staff was very off-putting. The recurring theme of negative attitudes from the staff makes me wonder if there is a bigger problem with how this establishment is run. They didn't seem to enjoy working there and appeared stressed out. If you don't enjoy your job, don't take it out on well-meaning patrons. For example, the front of the house (Esther) didn't exude sincere hospitality which is what a hostess's job is, right? She was also dishonest about the reservation situation when I inquired about table availability. The server was rushed and passive aggressive and didn't know her menu. I tried to engage her with friendly comments along the way and she was too stressed out to care.
To try to end on a positive note, the food was ok (but not memorable). However, there is an Italian restaurant right around the corner that far exceeds the food and provides a kinder and much more refined experience. Thanks for reminding me why I didn't come back for years, Cantinetta. Lesson learned."

"Capital D Cafe","https://www.yelp.com/biz/capital-d-cafe-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff W.","This is easily my favorite cafe in Capitol Hill. I stumbled in here one day a last year while hunting for a quick sandwich, and am so very glad I did. The food is delicious and is prepared quickly, but just as importantly, the owners (Katarina and her husband) are two of the nicest, sweetest, and most friendly people I have ever met. There's limited space to eat inside, so plan to get your food to go! My favorite sandwich is hands-down the Turkey Pastrami Panini, although I have also fallen victim to the Spinach Delish Crepe or the Breakfast bagel. If you're eyeing up something sweet, I highly recommend the Nutella Crepe or Carrot Cake, as well as a quintessential go-to Chai Latte.
Do yourself a favor and check out Capital D cafe the next time you're around 15th - you will NOT regret it."
